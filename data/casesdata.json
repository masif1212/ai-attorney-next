Arooj Lateef, respondent No.2 herein, was married to the petitioner on 21-10-2007. Differences arose shortly after marriage between the spouses Arooj Lateef, therefore, filed two suits against the petitioner for dissolution of marriage and maintenance, dowry articles and birth expenses of Rs.10,000. Parties were summoned by the learned Family Judge. The petitioner filed written reply to both the suits. He took legal as well as factual objections/defences in his written replies.\n  3. On 30-6-2009 Arooj Latif made a statement before the learned Judge Family Court that she did not want reconciliation with the petitioner and that her suit for dissolution of marriage should be decreed on the basis of Khula. In view of the statement of the plaintiff and having satisfied himself that re-conciliation efforts between the parties had, failed, the Judge Family Court proceeded to pass an order for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula in terms of section 10(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964.\n  4. In the other suit for maintenance etc, the learned Judge Family Court passed an order dated 30-6-2009. He fixed tentative interim maintenance allowance for the minor daughter of the parties in the sum of Rs.1500 per month to be paid by the defendant before 14th day of every month. Although the petitioner has challenged both the afore-said orders through this petition, the learned counsel did not address any arguments regarding the order relating to fixation of interim maintenance allowance. This Court is, therefore, justified in concluding that he has abandoned that challenge.\n  5. As far as the order dated 30-6-2009 is concerned, whereby decree for dissolution of marriage was passed, the learned counsel has argued that the order is illegal. According to him it was passed without providing to the petitioner an opportunity of being-heard. The learned counsel has further argued that the provisions of section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 are mandatory and after a pre-trial hearing as ordained by subsection (1) and, if necessary, after going through the procedures provided in subsections (2) and (3), the Court is required to frame issues and fix a date for recording of evidence. The learned counsel contends that the afore-said mandatory requirements have not been fulfilled. Hence the order dated 30-6-2009 whereby dissolution of marriage has been ordered is illegal and is liable to be set aside.\n  6. I have considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner. I do not find myself in agreement with his interpretation of section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 and its proviso. The proviso to section 10 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, was added by the Family Courts (Amendment) Ordinance (LV of 2002) dated 1st October, 2002. It has an overriding effect. Through the said proviso the Family Court has been granted power to pass a decree for dissolution of marriage forthwith if reconciliation fails. It is quite clear that a Family Court is not obligated to follow the sequential order given in section 10 ibid in the event of failure of reconciliation where a decree for dissolution of marriage is sought/ granted on the ground of Khula.\n  7. The proviso to subsection (4) of section 10 of West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 had conferred powers and jurisdiction on Family Courts to dissolve a marriage on the basis of \"Khula\" if despite efforts made by it for reconciliation no scope was left for spouses to live together. Proviso to section 10(4) is couched in such language, containing anon obstante clause giving wide power to the Family Court to dissolve the marriage when facts of the case would permit such course. The provision was enacted to avoid unnecessary delays which occurred in the past when suits for dissolution of marriage were tried like ordinary civil suits and it took years for such suits to reach a conclusion causing hardship and misery for the woman who was dragged through endless litigation involving a union that had practically come to an end. To suppress such mischief the legislature had enacted this beneficial provision conferring jurisdiction on Family Courts to dissolve the marriage forthwith on the basis of \"Khula\" if despite efforts made for reconciliation the wife refused to reconcile and go back to her husband. In this regard reference can usefully be made to PLD 1984 SC 549, PLD 1983 Lah.549, 1999 YLR 875, 2004 YLR 3090, 2005 CLC 909, 2005 YLR 1648, 2005 CLC t844 and PLD 2007 Lah. 425. In all the afore-said judgments the power of the Family Court to pass a decree for dissolution of marriage, forthwith, on failure of conciliation proceedings has been affirmed. It is evident from a perusal of the order dated 30-6-2009 as well as the statement of Arooj Lateef that pre-trial reconciliation efforts did not succeed. The learned Judge Family Court, therefore, correctly exercised his jurisdiction to decree the suit under section 10(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964 on the basis of \"Khula\". The petitioner has not mentioned anything in the petition which may even remotely suggest either, that there was any defect in the pre-trial reconciliation proceedings or that such reconciliation efforts had not failed. The finding of the trial Court is unexceptionable and no interference is called for.\n  8. As far as the order relating to interim maintenance for the minor child is concerned, the only grounds mentioned in the petition to challenge the same are that the petitioner is unable to pay the said amount as his monthly income allegedly is only financial resources. In the absence of any material on record to support this position, to my mind, this hardly furnishes any justification to withhold payment of maintenance allowance for a minor child. There is sufficient material on record to warrant a tentative assessment of the petitioner's income by the learned Judge Family Court and fixation of tentative maintenance allowance. This has fairly and reasonably been done by the learned Courts below after due application of mind, considering the basic needs of a minor child. Even otherwise, as stated above, the learned counsel has not addressed any arguments against the said order and has skirted repeated inquiries from this Court as to whether or not the said amount is being paid by the petitioner.\n  9. In view of what has been discussed above, I do not find any flaw or jurisdictional error in the findings of the learned lower Courts. There is no merit in the petition. It is, therefore, dismissed in limine.\n  M.U.Y./S-268/L Petition dismisse",

Firstly, that there are several F.I.Rs registered against the petitioner, inter alia, alleging the issuance of fake licences in order to support illegal sale and trafficking of arms. Learned counsel for the petitioner has explained that the seven F.I.Rs. registered through a short span of time in the year 2004 and 2005 were motivated by the animus of a police officer serving in the local area at the time. Out of those seven F.I.Rs. the petitioner has been able to obtain acquittal and or/discharge in five F.I.Rs. and the remaining two F.I.Rs. are still pending. The second ground of cancellation of the petitioner's licences is that he acquired the dealership licence of Ijaz Fareed and Company under a private agreement of partnership but operated the same under a different name i.e. Mohmand & Company without obtaining the approval of the competent authority. The application for transfer of the licence to the new name was made for the first time in 2007, seven years after the petitioner commenced the business purportedly under the said dealership licences.\n  2. Learned counsel for the petitioner has assailed the impugned order on technical grounds relating to the incompetence of a designated hearing officer to decide the matter on behalf of the respondent No.2. That objection however, does not answer the afore-noted two principal grounds upon which the cancellation is based. Clearly with criminal cases pending against the petitioner there should be no question of the dealership licences being resorted. Learned counsel for the petitioner concedes that the so long as any criminal cases are pending against the petitioner, he does- not have any entitlement to claim the restoration of the licences. However, if the petitioner successfully obtains discharge/ acquittal in such cases, he seeks a right to approach the competent authority for the revival/restoration of such licences.\n  3. On that question learned Assistant Advocate General raises objection that the petitioner has run business for seven years without even applying for permission to operate the dealership licences issued in the name of another person. He submits that the petitioner is disqualified from claiming restoration. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that there are several precedents available with the petitioners in which the respondent government authorities have allowed post facto transfer of dealerships where the antecedents of the new operator are satisfactory. On that score the impugned order has not given a finding nor has discussed the past precedents as well as the relevant rules on the subject.\n  4. Accordingly, it is ordered that if the petitioner is able to exculpate himself from all criminal cases - registered against him he may approach the respondent No.2 for considering in accordance with law the revival/restoration of the licences which stand cancelled under the impugned order. Since on the precedents claimed by the petitioner and for the relevant law to be disclosed the second ground would have to be decided- afresh by the respondent No.2, therefore, the cancellation of the licences shall be held in abeyance until a decision by the respondent No.2 on the said point is made in this matter. The petitioner is granted six months from the date of this order to clear himself of the criminal cases in order to approach the respondent No.2. Beyond that he shall lose the right to claim revival of his cancelled dealership licence.

The respondents in their reply have taken objections that the petitioners have no locus standi to file the suit as they have no interest in the land in question. It has been additionally stated that portion of the graveyard is coming in the right of way of the \"Ring Road\" and in order to relocate the same, the Provincial Government has acquired land measuring 2 Kanals, 17 Marlas and 175 sq. feet in Khasra No.1765/1 and the affected graves will be shifted to the said land. It has further been stated that all efforts have been made to avoid the said land under the graveyard, but, because of the over all design, the land to the said extent has to be utilized for the project which is being executed for the public welfare.\n  3. The learned counsel for the petitioners contend that under the law graveyard cannot be acquired and even in the relevant notification the same has been excluded and as such the respondents have no lawful authority to utilize the land under the graveyard in the said project.\n  4. The learned Assistant Advocate-General on the other hand, contends that the petitioners cannot be said to have any grievance as admittedly they are not vested with any title in the suit-land. He, however, undertakes at the bar and explains that the land comprising Khasra No.1765/1 measuring 2 Kanals, 17 Marlas and 175 sq. feet has been acquired which is at a distance of only few hundred feet from the said graveyard land mentioned in the writ petition and the respondents shall take all steps to make arrangements for shifting of the graves from the affected portion to the said acquired land and to bury the remains strictly in accordance with the Islamic Injunctions in cooperation with the concerned persons.\n  5.

The brief facts narrated in this petition are that the petitioners are the successor in interest of respondents No.1-A to 1-C. Sher Muhammad filed a suit for declaration along with consequential relief on 11-12-1977 while alleging that one Mst. Nooran Bibi daughter of Karim Bakhsh was his sister and she was owner of property consisting of agricultural land measuring 104 Kanals, 13 Marlas bearing square No.196 (Killas Nos.13, 14/2, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24 and 25) and Square No.206 (Killas Nos.18. 19 and 20) entered in Khata No.58 Khatauni No.72, mentioned in the Jamabandi for the years, 1968-1969 and a house along with tube well situated in village Ishreke Tehsil and District Sheikhupura. It was alleged in the plaint that said Mst. Nooran Bibi was about 80 years of age and also an uneducated Paradansheen lady and having no connection or relations with the petitioners or even their successors. It was also alleged that the petitioners were not related to her in any manner whatsoever. It is also alleged that the petitioners persuaded Mst. Nooran to execute a general power of attorney in their favour, so that they could collect the share of produce from the agricultural land in question and also for management of the said property. It is also alleged in the plaint that petitioners in collusion with the staff of Sub-Registrar Sheikhupura got executed Gift-deed in their own favour instead of general power of attorney. It is further alleged that Nooran Bibi neither gifted nor delivered the possession of the suit property to the petitioners and the Gift-deed stated to have been procured through fraud and misrepresentation. Thereafter, Mst. Nooran Bibi in her life time assailed the validity of Gift-deed through a suit for declaration before the Court of learned Civil Judge on 15-2-1977 against the petitioners. During the pendency of the suit respondent No.2 moved an application to be impleaded as sole heir of the deceased Mst. Nooran Bibi and he was impleaded as such. Thereafter, a compromise was effected between the respondent No.2 and petitioners and as such a consent decree was .passed in the suit and the fact of execution of Gift-deed was denied by the deceased lady and in this respect she filed a suit for declaration with consequential relief against the petitioners and respondent No.2. The petitioners while contesting the suit filed written statement in the said suit thereby controverting the inheritance and relationship of Sher Muhammad. According to the petitioner said Mst. Nooran appeared herself before the Sub-Registrar in connection with execution of the Gift-deed. The suit was contested by petitioners and respondent No.2 and due to the divergent pleadings of the parties issues were framed. According to the petitioners at the time of examination of the plaintiff's witness namely Sharif ul Rehman, petitioner No.1 Muhammad Sharif made a statement to the effect that if the said witness deposed on Holy Qur'an that Mst. Nooran Bibi did not execute the gift-deed in favour of the petitioners, the suit, might be decreed. The said witness deposed as desired by petitioner No.1 Muhammad Sharif and thereupon the suit was decreed in favour of Sher Muhammad plaintiff. After the suit was decreed, the petitioners filed an application under section 12(2), C.P.C. and challenged the decree dated 6-3-1985. The said application was dismissed by the trial Court vide order dated 3-6-1996. Thereafter the petitioners filed an appeal against the said dismissal order, which was dismissed by learned Additional District Judge, Sheikhupura vide his order dated 18-9-1999. Then the petitioner filed a writ petition against the said order which was accepted and case was remanded back to the trial Court for its de novo decision on merits. According to the petitioner learned trial Court before whom the case was remanded vide order dated 26-7-2004 observed that proceedings were to be conducted in the original suit and the petition under section 12(2), C.P.C. was consigned to the record. According to the petitioner during the pendency of suit said Sher Muhammad passed away and the respondent No.1-a to 1-c were impleaded as party being successors in interest of the deceased Sher Muhammad The learned trial Court observed while proceeding with the case that since the petition under section 12(2), C.P.C. was, consigned to the record, therefore, the proceedings be conducted in the case of suit filed by the deceased Sher Muhammad. However, the suit filed by the deceased Sher Muhammad was decreed vide order dated 27-5-2005. The petitioners aggrieved by the order and decree passed by the trial Court, filed an appeal, which finally came up for hearing before Mr. Bedar Bakhat the learned Additional District Judge, Sheikhupura, who after hearing the arguments c and perusing the record has been pleased to dismiss the appeal filed by the present petitioners by upholding the order passed by the learned trial Court vide judgment dated 2-3-2009. The petitioners feeling aggrieved by both the impugned judgment and decree have challenged the same through this revision.\n  3. The learned counsel for the petitioners contends that suit filed by Imam Bakash was decreed with the consent of the parties and application under section 12(2), C.P.C. was only remedy available to the respondent Sher Muhammad and the decree should have been passed in the said suit filed by Imam Bakash instead of the suit which was filed by Sher Muhammad respondent; that decree could not be declared as of legal effect and suit filed by Sher Muhammad which is lacking in said judgment and revision petition may be admitted for regular hearing; that Sher Muhammad respondent failed to prove his case that he was son of the real brother of Mst. Nooran Bibi and he was entitled to the property while the gift-deed was fully proved, which was registered in the name of the petitioners and findings arrived at by both the Courts below are liable to be set aside.\n  4. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and perused the documents attached with this petition.\n  5. The learned trial Court and learned Additional District Judge Sheikhupura had rightly come to the conclusion that the petitioners who claimed a gift-deed dated 25-11-1976 in favour of the petitioners had already failed to prove the said gift-deed and they remained unable to produce marginal witnesses. During the proceedings of the said suit an offer was made by the defendants that if Sharif-ul-Rehman who is marginal witness took oath on Holy Qur'an that gift-deed was executed in their favour, the suit would be decreed and in consequence thereof said Sharif ul Rehman made oath on Holy Qur'an that gift-deed was not executed, hence both the parties were entitled to 50% land and they are in possession of the said land since 1977. The said Sharif ul Rehman in the present proceedings appeared as P.W.4 on behalf of respondent Sher Muhammad and made statement that gift-deed was not genuine and Mst. Nooran Bibi had met him when in Katchehri/Courts and told him that she had come to execute power of attorney for supervising her land in favour of petitioners. So the gift-deed was not proved as the marginal witnesses did not appear in the Court in support of the respondents. Even otherwise Mst. Nooran Bibi in her life time had challenged the gift-deed by filing civil suit and she subsequently died and onus to prove the gift-deed was on the respondents, which they had failed to discharge and learned trial Court decided the matter regarding genuineness of the gift-deed against the petitioners.\n  6. Sher Muhammad respondent being Special Attorney of Mst. Nooran Bibi produced five witnesses in his support that Mst. Nooran Bibi was real sister of father of Sher Muhammad and he was a genuine heir of deceased Mst. Nooran Bibi and was entitled to his due share from the property and gift-deed was a bogus document. It is also proved that Mst. Nooran Bibi had filed suit through Mr. Zahid Hussain Bokhari Advocate who appeared as P.W.3 and both the Courts have rightly decided the matter in favour of respondent Sher Muhammad that he was real brother of Mst. Nooran Bibi while the gift-deed was bogus and the petitioners are not entitled to any share. The findings of both the Courts for declaring the gift-deed as a bogus document do not need any interference as the learned counsel for the petitioners has failed to point out any illegality. The contention that proceedings of the case were not taken in which consent decree was passed on 28-5-1977 and the said decree could be assailed by filing application under section 12(2), C.P.C.\n  7. From the perusal of the judgment it is clear that the application under section 12(2), C.P.C. was also filed in the suit which was decreed on 28-5-1977 and the said application was dismissed. The revision petition filed against the said application was also dismissed. Writ petition filed by Sher Muhammad was accepted and decree was set aside and proceedings were initiated by the learned Civil judge after consolidating the application 12(2), C.P.C. and the suit filed by Sher Muhammad respondent vide order dated 26-7-2004 which was never challenged by the petitioners despite the fact that the petitioners were very much aware of the proceedings in the suit. Even otherwise it is admitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the petitioners are in possession of the property of Nooran Bibi from the year, 1977. On the other hand it has been proved on merits that the claim of the petitioner, which was based on relationship with Mst. Nooran Bibi deceased being sister of their mother was falsified during the proceedings before both the Courts and on the other hand Sher Muhammad was genuine owner/heir of Mst. Nooran Bibi being his brother and he was entitled for his share from the property of Mst. Nooran Bibi who has been deprived of since 1977 after the death of Mst. Nooran Bibi and on technicalities this Civil Revision cannot be accepted in order to further deprive the heirs of said Sher Muhammad from their due share. Even otherwise the procedures are being made in order to facilitate the just decisions of the cases and not to thwart the justice and, however, it is not an illegality that the order has been passed in a suit which was filed by Imam Bakash for setting aside the consent decree. The arguments of learned counsel for the petitioners have no force to convince this Court. This petition is devoid of any force and concurrent findings of both the Courts below cannot be interfered with having been passed on the evidence available on the record. Dismissed in limine.\n  H.B.T./M-441/L Petition dismissed.",

Even otherwise the procedures are being made in order to facilitate the just decisions of the cases and not to thwart the justice and, however, it is not an illegality that the order has been passed in a suit which was filed by Imam Bakash for setting aside the consent decree. The arguments of learned counsel for the petitioners have no force to convince this Court. This petition is devoid of any force and concurrent findings of both the Courts below cannot be interfered with having been passed on the evidence available on the record. Dismissed in limine.\r\n  H.B.T./M-441/L Petition dismissed.",
      "case_proceddings": "3. The learned counsel for the petitioners contends that suit filed by Imam Bakash was decreed with the consent of the parties and application under section 12(2), C.P.C. was only remedy available to the respondent Sher Muhammad and the decree should have been passed in the said suit filed by Imam Bakash instead of the suit which was filed by Sher Muhammad respondent; that decree could not be declared as of legal effect and suit filed by Sher Muhammad which is lacking in said judgment and revision petition may be admitted for regular hearing; that Sher Muhammad respondent failed to prove his case that he was son of the real brother of Mst. Nooran Bibi and he was entitled to the property while the gift-deed was fully proved, which was registered in the name of the petitioners and findings arrived at by both the Courts below are liable to be set aside.\r\n  4. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and perused the documents attached with this petition.\r\n  5. The learned trial Court and learned Additional District Judge Sheikhupura had rightly come to the conclusion that the petitioners who claimed a gift-deed dated 25-11-1976 in favour of the petitioners had already failed to prove the said gift-deed and they remained unable to produce marginal witnesses. During the proceedings of the said suit an offer was made by the defendants that if Sharif-ul-Rehman who is marginal witness took oath on Holy Qur'an that gift-deed was executed in their favour, the suit would be decreed and in consequence thereof said Sharif ul Rehman made oath on Holy Qur'an that gift-deed was not executed, hence both the parties were entitled to 50% land and they are in possession of the said land since 1977. The said Sharif ul Rehman in the present proceedings appeared as P.W.4 on behalf of respondent Sher Muhammad and made statement that gift-deed was not genuine and Mst. Nooran Bibi had met him when in Katchehri/Courts and told him that she had come to execute power of attorney for supervising her land in favour of petitioners. So the gift-deed was not proved as the marginal witnesses did not appear in the Court in support of the respondents. Even otherwise Mst. Nooran Bibi in her life time had challenged the gift-deed by filing civil suit and she subsequently died and onus to prove the gift-deed was on the respondents, which they had failed to discharge and learned trial Court decided the matter regarding genuineness of the gift-deed against the petitioners.\r\n  6. Sher Muhammad respondent being Special Attorney of Mst. Nooran Bibi produced five witnesses in his support that Mst. Nooran Bibi was real sister of father of Sher Muhammad and he was a genuine heir of deceased Mst. Nooran Bibi and was entitled to his due share from the property and gift-deed was a bogus document. It is also proved that Mst. Nooran Bibi had filed suit through Mr. Zahid Hussain Bokhari Advocate who appeared as P.W.3 and both the Courts have rightly decided the matter in favour of respondent Sher Muhammad that he was real brother of Mst. Nooran Bibi while the gift-deed was bogus and the petitioners are not entitled to any share. The findings of both the Courts for declaring the gift-deed as a bogus document do not need any interference as the learned counsel for the petitioners has failed to point out any illegality. The contention that proceedings of the case were not taken in which consent decree was passed on 28-5-1977 and the said decree could be assailed by filing application under section 12(2), C.P.C.",

The dispute involved in this case pertains to land hearing Sr. Nos.48 to 54 and 119 to 150 situated in Deh Ghorbari, Taluka Keti Bunder hereinafter to be referred to as \"the suit-land\". The applicants/plaintiffs claimed that suit-land was State land and entered in the record as such as is evident from the order dated 25-1-1978 passed by the then Deputy Commissioner Thatta. It was stated that the predecessor-in-interest of the respondents was granted lands bearing S.Nos.372 to 374 and 376 to 382 but, respondents Nos. 1 and 2, in collusion with the then Mukhtiarkar, Faqir Muhammad Panwhar, got the revenue record interpolated whereby the suit-land was also shown to be the grant land of the said Noor Muhammad in the years, 1923-1924 as his Qabooli land. Later on the suit-land was entered in the revenue record in favour of the respondents as being inherited from the father, the said Noor Muhammad. It is stated that in the year, 1973, the Mukhtiarkar, Shah Muhammad Kazi detected the above fraud in the revenue record and sent such report to respondent No.5. Deputy Commissioner, Thatta who ordered cancellation of the above entries which was done vide order dated 25-6-1974. This order was assailed before respondent No.3 in the appeal, namely, the Additional Commissioner, Hyderabad, who remanded the case to respondent No.5, who vide his order dated 25-1-1978, again maintained his previous order regarding cancellation of the entries. This order was again challenged before the said respondent No.3 but this time the appeal was dismissed vide order dated 6-3-1986 against which a revision was filed before respondent No.2 (The Senior Member, Board of Revenue), who, vide his order dated 15-10-1978; allowed the same and set aside the above two orders, dated 25-1-1978 and 6-3-1986, passed by respondents Nos.2 and 3.\n  3. The applicants, challenged the order dated 15-10-1987 passed by the Senior Member, Board of Revenue by filing Suit No.117 of 1991 before the Senior Civil Judge, Thatta for declaration, cancellation of entries and permanent injunction inter alia against the private respondents which was decreed vide judgment dated 22-2-2000. The respondents Muhammad Haroon and his brothers/L.Rs., being aggrieved by the judgment dated 22-2-2000, filed Civil Appeal No.16 of 2000 before the District Judge, Thatta, which was allowed vide judgment dated 6-11-2000 passed by learned II Additional District Judge, Thatta and, accordingly, the judgment dated 22-2-2000 passed in Suit No.117 of 1991 was set aside and the said suit was dismissed. This judgment dated 6-11-2000 passed by the learned II Additional District Judge, Thatta in Civil Appeal No.16 of 2000, was called in question before this Court through Revision Application No.255 of 2000, which was allowed vide judgment dated 11-3-2002 whereby the judgment dated 6-11-2000 was set aside and the case was remanded to the appellate Court to be decided either by the learned District Judge himself or by any other Additional District Judge, except the, one who decided the same earlier. Accordingly, though the case was again heard by II Additional District Judge, Thatta, but this time by a different Additional District Judge, namely, Mr. Anand Ram D. Seirani, while previously it was decided by Mr. Sirajuddin Qureshi, who allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and decree respectively dated 22-2-2000 and 28-2-2000 and dismissed Suit No.117 of 1991 filed by the present applicants. Hence, this revision application.\n  4. The learned trial Court, on the basis of the pleadings of the parties framed the following issues in Suit No.117 of 1991.\n  (1) Whether the suit-land is Na-Qabooli land and it was not granted to deceased Noor Muhammad Kanad in 1923-1924?\n  (2) Whether defendants Nos.7 to 9, mutated the suit-land in the name of their father fraudulently and subsequently got the Foti Khata of the same changed in their favour in collusion of Revenue Officials?\n  (3) Whether the defendants Nos.7 to 9 are not in possession of suit-land and they have not been cultivating the same?\n  (4) Whether the order of defendant No.2 is not legal?\n  (5) Whether the defendants Nos.7 to 9 have not mutated the suit-land in the name of their father by way of fraud and subsequently got the same Foti Khata changed in their favour in collusion of Revenue Officers?\n  (6) Whether defendants Nos.7 to 9 are in possession of suit-land?\n  (7) Whether the defendants Nos.7 to 9 are legal owners of suit-land?\n  (8) Whether the suit is maintainable in law?\n  (9) Whether the suit is not time-barred?\n  (10) Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to file this suit?\n  (11) Whether the plaintiffs have any cause of action to file this suit?\n  5. The learned trial Court answered issues Nos. 1 to 4 and 8 to 11 in the affirmative and issues Nos.5 to 7 in the negative and decreed the suit vide judgment dated 22-2-2000 which was challenged through Civil Appeal No.16 of 2000. This appeal was decided twice: once vide judgment dated 6-11-2000 when the learned II Additional District Judge, Thatta allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment dated 22-2-2000 and dismissed the suit holding that the same was barred by limitation. This appellate order was impugned in R.A. No.255 of 2000 which was allowed vide judgment dated 11-3-2002, the impugned judgment was set aside and the case was remanded to the appellate Court to decide it on merits. Therefore, once again Civil Appeal No.16 of 2000 was heard, but this time by a learned Additional District Judge other than the one who had earlier decided the said civil appeal, and vide judgment dated 30-6-2006, again allowed the civil appeal, set aside the judgment and decree passed in Civil Suit No.117 of 1991 and dismissed the suit, but this time it was so dismissed on merits rather than on technicalities, as was previously done. The learned II-Additional District Judge formulated the following point for determination:---\n  \"Whether defendants Nos.7 to 9 are legal owners of the suit-land which was inherited by them from their father Noor Muhammad and whether the suit-land was Qabooli land and it was belonging to deceased Noor Muhammad and entered in his name in the Years, 1923-1924?\n  6. The learned appellate Court, while answering the above issue, held as under:-\n  \"The burden to prove this point lies upon the appellants and appellant Muhammad Haroon during his evidence before the trial Court has supported their case as setup in the written statement and deposed that the suit-land was Qabooli land and belonging to deceased Noor Muhammad their father and the same was entered in Village Form-A (old) in the years, 1923-1924 as well as in the year, 1925-1926, his name was also appearing in the record of rights for the year, 1935-1936. He further deposed that after the death of their father the Foti Khata was mutated in favour of the appellants who were his sons as is evident from Village Form-VII bearing Entry No.10/A and 10-10 dated 6-1-1973. They have produced all the relevant documents showing their ownership over the suit-land since, 1923-1924 which are available on the record of trial Court in the original suit. He further deposed that order of Deputy Commissioner Thatta in favour of private respondents was illegal and the same was set aside by the Member Board of Revenue Hyderabad in Revision application on 15-10-1987, he further deposed that no fraud whatever was committed by their deceased father with the collusion that the suit-land was not added in the village Form VII' in the year, 1973 through interpolation, forgery or fraud in the name of their father Noor Muhammad.\n  From the above piece of evidence and old huge documentary evidence it is established that deceased Noor Muhammad was the owner of the suit-land, and after his death the suit-land was mutated in the name of the appellants who are in possession of the suit-land and paying the land revenue to the Government, such receipts have also been brought on record, to establish their title over the suit-land as well as their possession.\"\n  7. On the point of alleged fraud having been committed in getting the suit-land registered in the name of the predecessor-in-interest of the appellants, the learned appellate Court held as under:---\n  \"there is no direct evidence on the point of fraud as the private respondent No.7 was neither the witness nor party to the proceedings before the Mahalkari or before any revenue authority and he had also not produced any documents to show that the Foti Khata was changed fraudulently.\"\n  8. About the maintainability of the suit before the trial Court, the learned appellate Court observed as under:--\n  \"The record shows that from the government side the representative of Barrage Department also appeared in the witness box and deposed that no portion from the suit-land was ever allotted to any of the plaintiff. In the circumstances of (sic) the suit of the plaintiff fails and the same was liable to be dismissed as this aspect of the case was ignored by the learned Court while deciding the suit.\"\n  As regards the judgment of the trial Court, the- learned Additional District Judge further held as under:---\n  \"The record further shows that the learned trial Court has decided all the issues without giving the proper reasons and ignoring the documentary as well as oral evidence produced by the appellants.\"\n  9. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record and the case-law cited before me.\n  10. Learned counsel for the applicants contended that in violation of the judgment in R.A. No.255 of 2000, the appellate Court did not decide all the points for determination. He submitted that the applicants are in possession of the government land and are entitled to remain in possession till action is taken by government. He submitted that possession is a valid title against all persons except the true owner. He also submitted that no point with regard to the maintainability of the suit and the fraudulent actions of the respondents were framed, therefore, assumption of jurisdiction was invalid. He prays that the revision may be allowed, the appeal may be dismissed and the judgment and decree of the trial Court may be restored.\n  11. On the other hand, Mr. Inam Nabi Soomro, learned counsel for respondents. Nos.1 to 3, submitted that the land was in the name of predecessor-in-interest of the respondents, namely, Noor Muhammad, and Foti Khata was mutated in favour of the legal heirs of the said Noor Muhammad, who are the present respondents. He submitted that in case of conflicting judgments the judgment of the appellate Court is to be given preference. He submitted that the judgment of the appellate Court is based on proper appreciation of the evidence available on record. He then submitted that fraud though alleged but has not been proved by the respondents. He finally contended that there is no defect in the impugned judgment. He relied on the following reported cases:---\n  Mir Muhammad v. Ghulam Muhammad PLD 1996 Kar.202, (2) Hafiz Ali Ahmed v. Muhammad Asad PLD 1999 Kar. 354; (3) AASA v. Ibrahim 2000 CLC 500 and (4) S. Shahid Ahmed Hashmi v. Chairman, Screening Committee, Lahore 1978 SCMR 367.\n  12. In the case in hand, firstly, the learned II Additional District Judge, Thatta allowed the appeal filed by the present appellants and dismissed the suit of the respondents on the ground of limitation. However, this Court, vide order passed in Revision Application No.255 of 2000, remanded the case back to the appellate Court to decide it afresh ignoring the question of limitation as it was decided by the learned Single Judge himself. The appeal was again heard and was once again dismissed by the impugned judgment on merits. On the basis of the evidence adduced by the parties the learned appellate Court reached the conclusion that: (i) the deceased Noor Muhammad was the owner of the suit-land and after his death the suit-land was mutated in the name of his legal heirs, namely, the present appellants, (ii) that there is no direct evidence on the point of fraud and no document has been produced to show that the Foti-Khata was changed fraudulently, (iii) the orders of the Deputy Commissioner, Thatta as well as the Additional Commissioner, Thatta were set aside by the Member, Board of Revenue, (iv) that no portion of the suit-land was ever allotted to any of the private respondents plaintiffs, and (v) the trial Court has decided all the issues without giving proper reasons therefore.\n  13. So far as the contention of the learned counsel for the applicants that all the points for determination have been decided in violation of law and order of the High Court is without any force as proper points have been formulated and decided and in such circumstances framing of issues was not necessary. Learned counsel also contended that no point with regard to maintainability of the suit and fraudulent entries has been framed. It is a settled principle of law that if points for determination had not been formulated in a particular form but substantial justice would have been done by the Court by addressing itself to the material points in controversy and recording findings on the points before it. In this case the points before he learned appellate Court have been addressed and findings thereon have been recorded and, therefore, substantial justice has been done. I am fortified in my view by the judgment reported as Hafiz Ali Ahmed through L.Rs. v. Muhammad Abad and others PLD 1999 Kar. 354.\n  14. Mr. Qamar Muhammad Khan, learned counsel for the applicants, in his arguments in rebuttal stated that prayer in the suit is not hit by section 42 of the Specific Relief Act as the suit was filed to save the government land. This, in itself, is an admission that the plaintiffs/respondents have no right or title in the suit and the suit should have been dismissed on this ground. No duty was cast up on the plaintiffs/respondents, to take the pain of filing a suit at huge expenses just to protect the government land. The question of fraud was brought to the notice of the relevant authorities by Mahalkari, Shah Muhammad Kazi and the matter reached its logical conclusion when it was finally decided by the Member, Board of Revenue in favour of the respondents. No grievance was caused to the respondents/plaintiffs by the order of the Member, Board of Revenue. Only the Government could have challenged the said order. However, for reasons best known to the plaintiffs/respondents, they took it upon themselves to file the suit.\n  15. A civil revision application is filed under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which reads asunder:---\n  \"115. Revision.-- The High Court may call for the record of any case which has been decided by any Court subordinate to such High Court and in which no appeal lies thereto, and if such subordinate Court appears-\n  (a) to have exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or\n  (b) to have failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or\n  (c) to have acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity,\n  the High Court may make such order in the case as it thinks fit.\"\n  16. Thus, it will be seen that provisions of section 115, C.P.C. envisage interference by the High Court only on account of jurisdiction alone i.e. if a Court subordinate to the High Court has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it, or has irregularly exercised a jurisdiction vested in it or has not exercised such jurisdiction so vested in it. It is settled law that when a Court has jurisdiction to decide a question it has jurisdiction to decide it rightly or wrongly both in fact and law. The mere fact that its decision is erroneous in law does not amount to illegal or irregular exercise of jurisdiction. For an applicant to succeed under section 115, C.P.C., he has to show that there is some material defect or procedure or disregard of some rule of law in the manner of reaching that wrong decision. In other words, there must be some distinction between jurisdiction to try and determine a matter and erroneous action of Court in exercise of such jurisdiction. It is a settled principle of law that erroneous conclusions of law or fact can be corrected in appeals and not by way of a revision which primarily deals with the question of jurisdiction of a Court i.e. whether a Court has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it or has not exercised a jurisdiction vested in it or has exercised a jurisdiction vested in it illegally or with material irregularity.\n  17. No such infirmity has been shown by counsel for the applicants to call for interference in the impugned judgment by this Court. The case-law relied upon has not been discussed as it was not relevant for the purposes of deciding this revision.\n  18. Moreover, in the case of Mir Muhammad alias Miral v. Ghulam Muhammad PLD 1996 Kar. 202, it was held that, \"It is settled proposition of law that in the event of conflict of judgment, view expressed by the appellate Court should ordinarily be preferred unless the same is contrary to evidence on record or in violation of the settled principles for administration of justice.\" In the present case, learned counsel for the applicants has failed to show that the findings of fact arrived by the learned appellate Court are contrary to the evidence on record or in violation of settled principles of law.\n  19. In the case of AASA v. Ibrahim 2000 CLC 500, a learned single Judge of the Quetta High Court held that, \"If no error of law or defect in procedure had been committed in coming to a finding of fact, the High Court cannot substitute such finding merely because a different finding could be given.\n  20. The upshot of the above discussion is that this revision application is dismissed having no merits.\n  S.A.K./A-142/K Revision dismissed.",

Accordingly, though the case was again heard by II Additional District Judge, Thatta, but this time by a different Additional District Judge, namely, Mr. Anand Ram D. Seirani, while previously it was decided by Mr. Sirajuddin Qureshi, who allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and decree respectively dated 22-2-2000 and 28-2-2000 and dismissed Suit No.117 of 1991 filed by the present applicants. Hence, this revision application.\r\n  4. The learned trial Court, on the basis of the pleadings of the parties framed the following issues in Suit No.117 of 1991.\r\n  (1) Whether the suit-land is Na-Qabooli land and it was not granted to deceased Noor Muhammad Kanad in 1923-1924?\r\n  (2) Whether defendants Nos.7 to 9, mutated the suit-land in the name of their father fraudulently and subsequently got the Foti Khata of the same changed in their favour in collusion of Revenue Officials?\r\n  (3) Whether the defendants Nos.7 to 9 are not in possession of suit-land and they have not been cultivating the same?\r\n  (4) Whether the order of defendant No.2 is not legal?\r\n  (5) Whether the defendants Nos.7 to 9 have not mutated the suit-land in the name of their father by way of fraud and subsequently got the same Foti Khata changed in their favour in collusion of Revenue Officers?\r\n  (6) Whether defendants Nos.7 to 9 are in possession of suit-land?\r\n  (7) Whether the defendants Nos.7 to 9 are legal owners of suit-land?\r\n  (8) Whether the suit is maintainable in law?\r\n  (9) Whether the suit is not time-barred?\r\n  (10) Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to file this suit?\r\n  (11) Whether the plaintiffs have any cause of action to file this suit?\r\n  5. The learned trial Court answered issues Nos. 1 to 4 and 8 to 11 in the affirmative and issues Nos.5 to 7 in the negative and decreed the suit vide judgment dated 22-2-2000 which was challenged through Civil Appeal No.16 of 2000. This appeal was decided twice: once vide judgment dated 6-11-2000 when the learned II Additional District Judge, Thatta allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment dated 22-2-2000 and dismissed the suit holding that the same was barred by limitation. This appellate order was impugned in R.A. No.255 of 2000 which was allowed vide judgment dated 11-3-2002, the impugned judgment was set aside and the case was remanded to the appellate Court to decide it on merits. Therefore, once again Civil Appeal No.16 of 2000 was heard, but this time by a learned Additional District Judge other than the one who had earlier decided the said civil appeal, and vide judgment dated 30-6-2006, again allowed the civil appeal, set aside the judgment and decree passed in Civil Suit No.117 of 1991 and dismissed the suit, but this time it was so dismissed on merits rather than on technicalities, as was previously done. The learned II-Additional District Judge formulated the following point for determination:---\r\n  \"Whether defendants Nos.7 to 9 are legal owners of the suit-land which was inherited by them from their father Noor Muhammad and whether the suit-land was Qabooli land and it was belonging to deceased Noor Muhammad and entered in his name in the Years, 1923-1924?\r\n  6. The learned appellate Court, while answering the above issue, held as under:-\r\n  \"The burden to prove this point lies upon the appellants and appellant Muhammad Haroon during his evidence before the trial Court has supported their case as setup in the written statement and deposed that the suit-land was Qabooli land and belonging to deceased Noor Muhammad their father and the same was entered in Village Form-A (old) in the years, 1923-1924 as well as in the year, 1925-1926, his name was also appearing in the record of rights for the year, 1935-1936. He further deposed that after the death of their father the Foti Khata was mutated in favour of the appellants who were his sons as is evident from Village Form-VII bearing Entry No.10/A and 10-10 dated 6-1-1973. They have produced all the relevant documents showing their ownership over the suit-land since, 1923-1924 which are available on the record of trial Court in the original suit. He further deposed that order of Deputy Commissioner Thatta in favour of private respondents was illegal and the same was set aside by the Member Board of Revenue Hyderabad in Revision application on 15-10-1987, he further deposed that no fraud whatever was committed by their deceased father with the collusion that the suit-land was not added in the village Form VII' in the year, 1973 through interpolation, forgery or fraud in the name of their father Noor Muhammad.\r\n  From the above piece of evidence and old huge documentary evidence it is established that deceased Noor Muhammad was the owner of the suit-land, and after his death the suit-land was mutated in the name of the appellants who are in possession of the suit-land and paying the land revenue to the Government, such receipts have also been brought on record, to establish their title over the suit-land as well as their possession.\"\r\n  7. On the point of alleged fraud having been committed in getting the suit-land registered in the name of the predecessor-in-interest of the appellants, the learned appellate Court held as under:---\r\n  \"there is no direct evidence on the point of fraud as the private respondent No.7 was neither the witness nor party to the proceedings before the Mahalkari or before any revenue authority and he had also not produced any documents to show that the Foti Khata was changed fraudulently.\"\r\n  8. About the maintainability of the suit before the trial Court, the learned appellate Court observed as under:--\r\n  \"The record shows that from the government side the representative of Barrage Department also appeared in the witness box and deposed that no portion from the suit-land was ever allotted to any of the plaintiff. In the circumstances of (sic) the suit of the plaintiff fails and the same was liable to be dismissed as this aspect of the case was ignored by the learned Court while deciding the suit.\"\r\n  As regards the judgment of the trial Court, the- learned Additional District Judge further held as under:---\r\n  \"The record further shows that the learned trial Court has decided all the issues without giving the proper reasons and ignoring the documentary as well as oral evidence produced by the appellants.\"\r\n  9. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record and the case-law cited before me.\r\n  10. Learned counsel for the applicants contended that in violation of the judgment in R.A. No.255 of 2000, the appellate Court did not decide all the points for determination. He submitted that the applicants are in possession of the government land and are entitled to remain in possession till action is taken by government. He submitted that possession is a valid title against all persons except the true owner. He also submitted that no point with regard to the maintainability of the suit and the fraudulent actions of the respondents were framed, therefore, assumption of jurisdiction was invalid. He prays that the revision may be allowed, the appeal may be dismissed and the judgment and decree of the trial Court may be restored.\r\n  11. On the other hand, Mr. Inam Nabi Soomro, learned counsel for respondents. Nos.1 to 3, submitted that the land was in the name of predecessor-in-interest of the respondents, namely, Noor Muhammad, and Foti Khata was mutated in favour of the legal heirs of the said Noor Muhammad, who are the present respondents. He submitted that in case of conflicting judgments the judgment of the appellate Court is to be given preference. He submitted that the judgment of the appellate Court is based on proper appreciation of the evidence available on record. He then submitted that fraud though alleged but has not been proved by the respondents. He finally contended that there is no defect in the impugned judgment. He relied on the following reported cases:---\r\n  Mir Muhammad v. Ghulam Muhammad PLD 1996 Kar.202, (2) Hafiz Ali Ahmed v. Muhammad Asad PLD 1999 Kar. 354; (3) AASA v. Ibrahim 2000 CLC 500 and (4) S. Shahid Ahmed Hashmi v. Chairman, Screening Committee, Lahore 1978 SCMR 367.\r\n  12. In the case in hand, firstly, the learned II Additional District Judge, Thatta allowed the appeal filed by the present appellants and dismissed the suit of the respondents on the ground of limitation. However, this Court, vide order passed in Revision Application No.255 of 2000, remanded the case back to the appellate Court to decide it afresh ignoring the question of limitation as it was decided by the learned Single Judge himself. The appeal was again heard and was once again dismissed by the impugned judgment on merits. On the basis of the evidence adduced by the parties the learned appellate Court reached the conclusion that: (i) the deceased Noor Muhammad was the owner of the suit-land and after his death the suit-land was mutated in the name of his legal heirs, namely, the present appellants, (ii) that there is no direct evidence on the point of fraud and no document has been produced to show that the Foti-Khata was changed fraudulently, (iii) the orders of the Deputy Commissioner, Thatta as well as the Additional Commissioner, Thatta were set aside by the Member, Board of Revenue, (iv) that no portion of the suit-land was ever allotted to any of the private respondents plaintiffs, and (v) the trial Court has decided all the issues without giving proper reasons therefore.\r\n  13. So far as the contention of the learned counsel for the applicants that all the points for determination have been decided in violation of law and order of the High Court is without any force as proper points have been formulated and decided and in such circumstances framing of issues was not necessary. Learned counsel also contended that no point with regard to maintainability of the suit and fraudulent entries has been framed. It is a settled principle of law that if points for determination had not been formulated in a particular form but substantial justice would have been done by the Court by addressing itself to the material points in controversy and recording findings on the points before it. In this case the points before he learned appellate Court have been addressed and findings thereon have been recorded and, therefore, substantial justice has been done. I am fortified in my view by the judgment reported as Hafiz Ali Ahmed through L.Rs. v. Muhammad Abad and others PLD 1999 Kar. 354.\r\n  14. Mr. Qamar Muhammad Khan, learned counsel for the applicants, in his arguments in rebuttal stated that prayer in the suit is not hit by section 42 of the Specific Relief Act as the suit was filed to save the government land. This, in itself, is an admission that the plaintiffs/respondents have no right or title in the suit and the suit should have been dismissed on this ground. No duty was cast up on the plaintiffs/respondents, to take the pain of filing a suit at huge expenses just to protect the government land. The question of fraud was brought to the notice of the relevant authorities by Mahalkari, Shah Muhammad Kazi and the matter reached its logical conclusion when it was finally decided by the Member, Board of Revenue in favour of the respondents. No grievance was caused to the respondents/plaintiffs by the order of the Member, Board of Revenue. Only the Government could have challenged the said order. However, for reasons best known to the plaintiffs/respondents, they took it upon themselves to file the suit.\r\n  15. A civil revision application is filed under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which reads asunder:---\r\n  \"115. Revision.-- The High Court may call for the record of any case which has been decided by any Court subordinate to such High Court and in which no appeal lies thereto, and if such subordinate Court appears-\r\n  (a) to have exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or\r\n  (b) to have failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or\r\n  (c) to have acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity,\r\n  the High Court may make such order in the case as it thinks fit.\"\r\n  16. Thus, it will be seen that provisions of section 115, C.P.C. envisage interference by the High Court only on account of jurisdiction alone i.e. if a Court subordinate to the High Court has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it, or has irregularly exercised a jurisdiction vested in it or has not exercised such jurisdiction so vested in it. It is settled law that when a Court has jurisdiction to decide a question it has jurisdiction to decide it rightly or wrongly both in fact and law. The mere fact that its decision is erroneous in law does not amount to illegal or irregular exercise of jurisdiction. For an applicant to succeed under section 115, C.P.C., he has to show that there is some material defect or procedure or disregard of some rule of law in the manner of reaching that wrong decision. In other words, there must be some distinction between jurisdiction to try and determine a matter and erroneous action of Court in exercise of such jurisdiction. It is a settled principle of law that erroneous conclusions of law or fact can be corrected in appeals and not by way of a revision which primarily deals with the question of jurisdiction of a Court i.e. whether a Court has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it or has not exercised a jurisdiction vested in it or has exercised a jurisdiction vested in it illegally or with material irregularity.\r\n  17. No such infirmity has been shown by counsel for the applicants to call for interference in the impugned judgment by this Court. The case-law relied upon has not been discussed as it was not relevant for the purposes of deciding this revision.",

ALI HASSAN RIZVI, J.--- Muhammad Asghar plaintiff/appellant had on 9-2-2002 filed a suit under Order XXXVII, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. for recovery of Rs.4,00,000 on the basis of an alleged pro note dated 3-6-2000.\n  2. Muhammad Hussain defendant/respondent moved an application under Order XXXVII, rule 2(2), C.P.C. seeking leave to appear and defend the suit which was allowed by the learned Additional District Judge, Depalpur by order dated 20-4-2002 subject to furnishing security equal to the suit amount within seven days otherwise it was directed that his application would stand dismissed. Vide order 13-11-2002 the learned trial Judge observed that the delay in furnishing security was condonable. He, therefore, allowed the defendant/respondent to submit his written statement. The written statement was accordingly filed on 23-11-2002. By the same order dated 13-11-2002 the learned trial Judge dismissed application of the plaintiff/appellant seeking the striking off defence of the defendant/respondent and decreeing the suit straightaway under Order XXXVII, rule 2(2), C.P.C. taking the averments in the plaint as admitted.\n  3. The trial proceeded on the following issues as framed on 25-2-2003.\n  \"Issues:\n  (1) Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action against the defendant? OPD;\n  (2) Whether the plaintiff has not come to the Court with clean hands and the defendant is entitled to special costs under section 35-A, C.P.C.? OPD;\n  (3) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the decree for recovery of Rs.4,00,000 on the basis of pro note dated 3-6-2000? OPP;\n  (4) Relief.\"\n  4. On conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional District Judge, vide judgment dated 5-7-2003 dismissed the suit with special costs of Rs.5,000 to be paid to the defendant/respondent. The present R.F.A. was filed on 16-10-2003 challenging the validity of the afore-said judgment and decree dated 5-7-2003.\n  5. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record.\n  6. Issue No.3 being crucial, was taken up by the learned trial Court in the first instance. The stance of the respondent/defendant in his written statement was that the plaintiff/appellant had no valid cause of action; that the suit was false and frivolous and that the alleged pro note was not testified by two witnesses. On facts, it was averred by the defendant/respondent that he had no acquaintance with the plaintiff/appellant Muhammad Asghar; that there was no Lain-Dain between him and the plaintiff/appellant; that he had never received any money and that the entire suit was based on false version. As to the execution of the pro note, it was the case of the defendant/respondent that he was village simpleton; that Zulfiqar who was son of Mst. Iqbal Begum the daughter of his Tayazad, Muhammad Jahangir, had some business relation with the plaintiff/appellant; that afore-said Zulfiqar was kept under illegal confinement by the plaintiff/appellant; that he defendant/respondent along with his father-in-law Abdul Aziz, had gone to get him released and at that time the plaintiff/appellant had unduly got his, thumb impressions on some papers.\n  7. The learned trial Judge after discussing the entire evidence found issued No.3 against the plaintiff/appellant holding that the defence version inspired his confidence; that no consideration was ever passed on to the defendant/respondent and' there was indeed a dispute between afore-said Zulfiqar and Muhammad Asghar.\n  8. Mian Muhammad Hussain, defendant/respondent appeared as D.W.1. He examined Zulfiqar as D.W.2. Their statements were found consistent with the defence version as given in the written statement. The learned trial Judge conversely found that Muhammad Zafar P.W.2 and Bashir Ahmad P.W.3 were shopkeepers and tenants of one Ghulam Abbas who was Mamoon of the plaintiff/appellant whereas P.W.4 Abdul Khaliq was a petition writer working in the chamber of father of the plaintiff/appellant. He, therefore, disbelieved' the evidence led by the plaintiff/appellant. We also find that tire statements of P.W.2, P.W.3 and P.W.4 as afore-mentioned lacked luster of impartiality. The plaintiff/ appellant Muhammad Asghar appeared as P.W.1. He failed to prove as to what was the occasion for advancing Rs.4,00,000 to the defendant/respondent on his simple request and there and then without any previous relationship, whatsoever. The defendant/respondent was an old man of 75 years.\n  9. After going through the evidence and ratiocination adopted by the learned trial Court, we find that the plaintiff/appellant had failed to prove his case as set up in the plaint. He was, therefore, not entitled to the decree for recovery of Rs.4,00,000. Consequently, we uphold the findings of the learned trial Court on this issue.\n  10. Since we have affirmed the findings of the learned trial Court on issue No.3 as above, it could not be held that the plaintiff/appellant had any valid cause of action. The learned trial Court had rightly come to the conclusion that the plaintiff/appellant had not come to the Court with clean hands. Suit was, therefore, rightly dismissed with special costs of Rs.5,000.\n  11. Learned counsel for the plaintiff/appellant nevertheless contended that the defendant/respondent having not furnished the, surety as directed by the learned trial Court by order dated 20-4-2002 within seven days, his written statement as also the evidence could not have been read on record and that consequently plaintiff/appellant was entitled to decree in terms of Order XXXVII, rule 2(2), C.P.C. According to learned counsel for the appellant, the defendant/respondent had failed to submit his. written statement and furnish security within seven days as directed by the learned trial Court by order dated 20-4-2002 and that, therefore, he having thus defaulted, the averments made in the plaint would be deemed to have been admitted entitling the appellant to a decree in terms of Order XXXVII, rule 2(2), C.P.C.\n  12. We have hesitation to go by the above contentions for reasons more than one. Firstly, the defendant/respondent was allowed to appear and defend the suit by order dated 20-4-2002 subject to the condition that he would furnish security equal to the suit amount within seven days. The learned trial Judge was moved by the plaintiff/appellant pointing out that the defendant/respondent having defaulted in furnishing surety within seven days, his defence be struck off and the suit be decreed straightaway. This application of the plaintiff/appellant was rejected by the learned trial Court on 13-11-2002 and 4-2-2003 which orders were not further agitated against. The plaintiff/appellant submitted himself to the trial being held by the learned trial Court after framing issues. He led evidence without demur. The afore-said orders could have been challenged in revision but nothing of the sorts was done. Greater always includes lesser and if the learned trial Judge had the mandate to direct furnishing of security within a certain period of time, he had the authority to extend time under section 148, C.P.C. and this is what he had done. We, therefore, feel that the plaintiff/appellant had conceptually accepted the orders dated 13-11-2002 and 4-2-2003 whereby the defendant/respondent was allowed to submit his written statement and requisite security till the next date. It may be noted that all procedural laws are framed for advancement of justice and to take a cause to a logical end for and against the litigating parties. Technicalities cannot be allowed to operate as tyrant masters so as to smother and frustrate the genuine claims. The provisions of section 148, C.P.C. were consciously invoked by the learned trial Court whereby delay was condoned on the application of the defendant/respondent. The said provisions could be brought into consideration either suo motu by the Court in the interest of justice or on the application of the party concerned. The provisions of section 5 of the Limitation Act have been made applicable to the proceedings of suit tried summarily under Order XXXVII, rule 3(3), C.P.C.\n  13. At the risk of repetition it may be observed that the plaintiff/ appellant did not challenge the orders dated 13-11-2002 or 4-2-2003 and now when he has lost his suit after full-dress trial, he cannot be allowed to turn round and rake up the same question, which was raised by him and did not find favour with the learned trial Court. In any case, nothing substantial was likely to run upon the above question when the plaintiff/appellant had no case on merits. That being so, the findings of the learned trial Court could neither be varied nor reversed nor interfered with in any manner vide section 99 of the C.P.C. The learned trial Judge in his aforesaid orders had also found that the defendant/ respondent had submitted surety bond on 6-5-2002 i.e. two days before the date fixed in the main case. He held that the omission on the part of defendant/respondent was bona fide and, therefore, deserved to be supplied. We have no reason to differ.\n  14. No other point was raised. No misreading of the evidence on record was pointed out either. We, therefore, uphold the judgment and decree of the learned trial Court dated 5-7-2003 dismissing the suit of the plaintiff/appellant and dismiss this Regular First Appeal with costs.\n  15. The record of the trial Court be returned intact.\n  S.A.K./M-397/L Appeal dismissed.",

      "case_judgement": " 13. At the risk of repetition it may be observed that the plaintiff/ appellant did not challenge the orders dated 13-11-2002 or 4-2-2003 and now when he has lost his suit after full-dress trial, he cannot be allowed to turn round and rake up the same question, which was raised by him and did not find favour with the learned trial Court. In any case, nothing substantial was likely to run upon the above question when the plaintiff/appellant had no case on merits. That being so, the findings of the learned trial Court could neither be varied nor reversed nor interfered with in any manner vide section 99 of the C.P.C. The learned trial Judge in his aforesaid orders had also found that the defendant/ respondent had submitted surety bond on 6-5-2002 i.e. two days before the date fixed in the main case. He held that the omission on the part of defendant/respondent was bona fide and, therefore, deserved to be supplied. We have no reason to differ.\r\n  14. No other point was raised. No misreading of the evidence on record was pointed out either. We, therefore, uphold the judgment and decree of the learned trial Court dated 5-7-2003 dismissing the suit of the plaintiff/appellant and dismiss this Regular First Appeal with costs.\r\n  15. The record of the trial Court be returned intact.\r\n  S.A.K./M-397/L Appeal dismissed.",
      "case_proceddings": ". The trial proceeded on the following issues as framed on 25-2-2003.\r\n  \"Issues:\r\n  (1) Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action against the defendant? OPD;\r\n  (2) Whether the plaintiff has not come to the Court with clean hands and the defendant is entitled to special costs under section 35-A, C.P.C.? OPD;\r\n  (3) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the decree for recovery of Rs.4,00,000 on the basis of pro note dated 3-6-2000? OPP;\r\n  (4) Relief.\"\r\n  4. On conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional District Judge, vide judgment dated 5-7-2003 dismissed the suit with special costs of Rs.5,000 to be paid to the defendant/respondent. The present R.F.A. was filed on 16-10-2003 challenging the validity of the afore-said judgment and decree dated 5-7-2003.\r\n  5. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record.\r\n  6. Issue No.3 being crucial, was taken up by the learned trial Court in the first instance. The stance of the respondent/defendant in his written statement was that the plaintiff/appellant had no valid cause of action; that the suit was false and frivolous and that the alleged pro note was not testified by two witnesses. On facts, it was averred by the defendant/respondent that he had no acquaintance with the plaintiff/appellant Muhammad Asghar; that there was no Lain-Dain between him and the plaintiff/appellant; that he had never received any money and that the entire suit was based on false version. As to the execution of the pro note, it was the case of the defendant/respondent that he was village simpleton; that Zulfiqar who was son of Mst. Iqbal Begum the daughter of his Tayazad, Muhammad Jahangir, had some business relation with the plaintiff/appellant; that afore-said Zulfiqar was kept under illegal confinement by the plaintiff/appellant; that he defendant/respondent along with his father-in-law Abdul Aziz, had gone to get him released and at that time the plaintiff/appellant had unduly got his, thumb impressions on some papers.\r\n  7. The learned trial Judge after discussing the entire evidence found issued No.3 against the plaintiff/appellant holding that the defence version inspired his confidence; that no consideration was ever passed on to the defendant/respondent and' there was indeed a dispute between afore-said Zulfiqar and Muhammad Asghar.\r\n  8. Mian Muhammad Hussain, defendant/respondent appeared as D.W.1. He examined Zulfiqar as D.W.2. Their statements were found consistent with the defence version as given in the written statement. The learned trial Judge conversely found that Muhammad Zafar P.W.2 and Bashir Ahmad P.W.3 were shopkeepers and tenants of one Ghulam Abbas who was Mamoon of the plaintiff/appellant whereas P.W.4 Abdul Khaliq was a petition writer working in the chamber of father of the plaintiff/appellant. He, therefore, disbelieved' the evidence led by the plaintiff/appellant. We also find that tire statements of P.W.2, P.W.3 and P.W.4 as afore-mentioned lacked luster of impartiality. The plaintiff/ appellant Muhammad Asghar appeared as P.W.1. He failed to prove as to what was the occasion for advancing Rs.4,00,000 to the defendant/respondent on his simple request and there and then without any previous relationship, whatsoever. The defendant/respondent was an old man of 75 years.\r\n  9. After going through the evidence and ratiocination adopted by the learned trial Court, we find that the plaintiff/appellant had failed to prove his case as set up in the plaint. He was, therefore, not entitled to the decree for recovery of Rs.4,00,000. Consequently, we uphold the findings of the learned trial Court on this issue.\r\n  10. Since we have affirmed the findings of the learned trial Court on issue No.3 as above, it could not be held that the plaintiff/appellant had any valid cause of action. The learned trial Court had rightly come to the conclusion that the plaintiff/appellant had not come to the Court with clean hands. Suit was, therefore, rightly dismissed with special costs of Rs.5,000.\r\n  11. Learned counsel for the plaintiff/appellant nevertheless contended that the defendant/respondent having not furnished the, surety as directed by the learned trial Court by order dated 20-4-2002 within seven days, his written statement as also the evidence could not have been read on record and that consequently plaintiff/appellant was entitled to decree in terms of Order XXXVII, rule 2(2), C.P.C. According to learned counsel for the appellant, the defendant/respondent had failed to submit his. written statement and furnish security within seven days as directed by the learned trial Court by order dated 20-4-2002 and that, therefore, he having thus defaulted, the averments made in the plaint would be deemed to have been admitted entitling the appellant to a decree in terms of Order XXXVII, rule 2(2), C.P.C.\r\n  12. We have hesitation to go by the above contentions for reasons more than one. Firstly, the defendant/respondent was allowed to appear and defend the suit by order dated 20-4-2002 subject to the condition that he would furnish security equal to the suit amount within seven days. The learned trial Judge was moved by the plaintiff/appellant pointing out that the defendant/respondent having defaulted in furnishing surety within seven days, his defence be struck off and the suit be decreed straightaway. This application of the plaintiff/appellant was rejected by the learned trial Court on 13-11-2002 and 4-2-2003 which orders were not further agitated against. The plaintiff/appellant submitted himself to the trial being held by the learned trial Court after framing issues. He led evidence without demur. The afore-said orders could have been challenged in revision but nothing of the sorts was done. Greater always includes lesser and if the learned trial Judge had the mandate to direct furnishing of security within a certain period of time, he had the authority to extend time under section 148, C.P.C. and this is what he had done. We, therefore, feel that the plaintiff/appellant had conceptually accepted the orders dated 13-11-2002 and 4-2-2003 whereby the defendant/respondent was allowed to submit his written statement and requisite security till the next date. It may be noted that all procedural laws are framed for advancement of justice and to take a cause to a logical end for and against the litigating parties. Technicalities cannot be allowed to operate as tyrant masters so as to smother and frustrate the genuine claims. The provisions of section 148, C.P.C. were consciously invoked by the learned trial Court whereby delay was condoned on the application of the defendant/respondent. The said provisions could be brought into consideration either suo motu by the Court in the interest of justice or on the application of the party concerned. The provisions of section 5 of the Limitation Act have been made applicable to the proceedings of suit tried summarily under Order XXXVII, rule 3(3), C.P.C.",

It was held that the petitioner plaintiff had not proved the performance of Talb-e-Muwathibat and consequently the judgment/ decree of the learned trial Court was reversed.\n  2. Brief facts of the case are that Asif Rashid petitioner-plaintiff filed suit against the respondent-defendant exercising his superior right of pre-emption with regard to Mutation No.1698 attested on 26-4-2006 through which an area of 15 Kanals in Khata Nos.125/327 to 338 measuring 793 Kanals and 1-Marla situated in village Aziz Abad, Tehsil and District Charsadda was sold by the vendor to the defendant-respondent. It is averred by the petitioner-plaintiff that the transaction had been made secretly for the sum of Rs.5,00,000 but in order to defeat the pre-emption right of the plaintiff, an exaggerated amount of Rs.10,00,000 was entered in the mutation. It is further stated, in the plaint, that the petitioner-plaintiff came to know about the sale in question on 8-7-2006 at 2-00 p.m. in his Hujra at village Shpano when Murad Ali son of Ashraf-ud-Din P.W.7, in presence of Khalid son of Lal Zamin P.W.6 and Mir Nawaz son of Multan P.W.5, informed him about the sale of the property in dispute and he declared Talb-e-Muwathibat in their presence at the same time. It has been further stated that on 15-7-2008 he sent registered notice of Talb-e-Ishhad in the name of the defendant-respondent with acknowledgement due.\n  3. The suit was contested by the respondent-defendant by filing written statement wherein various' legal and factual pleas were raised. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed:--\n  1. Whether the plaintiff has got a cause of action?\n  2. Whether plaintiff is estopped to sue?\n  3. Whether suit is time-barred?\n  4. Whether plaintiff has fulfilled the prerequisite condition of Talbs?\n  5. Whether plaintiff has got superior right of pre-emption?\n  6. What is the market value of the land in dispute?\n  7. Whether in case of decree defendant would be entitled for expenditure incurred on the land in dispute?\n  8. Whether plaintiff is entitled to the decree as prayed for?\n  9. Relief.\n  4. After recording pro and contra evidence of the parties and hearing rival arguments, the learned trial Court decreed the suit vide judgment and decree dated 10-7-2008.\n  5. The defendant-respondent preferred an appeal before the appellate Court. The learned Additional District Judge, Charsadda vide judgment dated 19-1-2009 reversed the judgment/decree dated 10-7-2008 by holding that the petitioner-plaintiff has failed to establish the performance of Talb-e-Muwathibat. About Talb-e-Ishhad, the learned appellate Court has observed that \"receipt of notice by the son of the respondent does not stand established. However, as observed in 2006 SCMR page 4 and 2008 MLD 307 (Lahore), receipt of the notice is immaterial. It is to be noted that when as in the present case Talb-e-Muwathibat is not proved, performance of Talb-e-Ishhad is inconsequential in nature having got no value in the eyes of law. The findings of the learned trial Court on issue No.4 are liable to be reversed in the circumstances\". In para.15, the learned appellate Court has observed that \"in light of what has been discussed above, the appeal in hand is partially accepted to the extent that the respondent has not performed the Talb-e-Muwathibat and Talb-e-Ishhad. The impugned judgment/decree is modified accordingly.\"\n  6. I have heard arguments from both sides, considered the same and perused the record with the valuable assistance of the learned counsel for the parties.\n  7. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the first appellate Court has materially erred by holding that the petitioner/ plaintiff has failed to establish the performance of Talb-e-Muwathibat and that the evidence has not been appreciated according to the principles laid down for appreciation of evidence in the civil cases. It was further contended that the evidence in the case was perused and evaluated by the learned appellate Court against the principle of appreciation of evidence and as such committed material irregularity; that the appellate Court has erred by picking a single sentence from the statement of P.W.4 petitioner wherein it is so recorded that\n  that the sentence can either be a slip of tongue or typographic mistake as the entire evidence is consistent on all material points including that the plaintiff was informed about the sale by Murad Ali; that the petitioner has established his right of pre-emption, cause of action and has complied with all the formalities required under section 13 of the N.-W.F.P. Pre-emption Act. 1987.\n  8. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent-defendant submitted that the revisional Court, on reappraisal of evidence, is not required to disturb the finding on a question of fact recorded by the appellant Court. Further that the same cannot be interfered with by the revisional Court under section 115, C.P.C. merely because on reappraisal the revisional Court forms a different opinion about the evidence and that such finding could only be set aside if the same had proceeded upon on misapprehension or had suffered from misreading or non-reading of material piece of evidence on record. The learned counsel further argued that the judgment of the appellate Court is based on proper appreciation of evidence and the suit of the petitioner/plaintiff has rightly been dismissed. However, he was not happy with the finding of the learned appellate Court about Tale-e-Ishhad.\n  9. It is the case of the petitioner in plaint as well as in his statement in Court that he was informed by Murad Ali P.W.7 at about 2-00 p.m. about the sale in question in presence of P.W.6 Khalid and Amir Nawaz P.W.5. The said Khalid and Amir Nawaz also appeared in the Court at P.W.5 and P.W.6 while Murad Ali informant appeared as P.W.7. All the three P.Ws supported the stance of the plaintiff on every material aspects. It was only a sentence in the cross-examination of P.W.4 petitioner/plaintiff which has been reproduced in the preceding paras., that led the appellate Court to the conclusion that if the informant had not met the plaintiff on 8-7-2006, how could the plaintiff allege that he was informed by the said informer and consequent upon such information he performed Talb-e-Muwathibat. While holding so, the learned appellate Court has altogether ignored the consistent evidence of the three witnesses, thoroughly cross examined by the other side but nothing contradictor could be brought from them and such evidence could not have been discarded on the basis of a single sentence more particularly when the sentence is totally inconsistent with the evidence produced by the petitioner/plaintiff in this case.\n  10 On going through the entire cross-examination of the plaintiff/P.W.4 including the sentence under discussion, the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner seems to be convincing one. This sentence is either a clerical mistake on part of the official who was recording the statement or a slip of tongue on part of P.W.4. In 2007 PLR 768 at page 771 in para.7, it has been observed that the standard of appraisal of evidence in civil cases is different from that applied in criminal cases as both the laws have laid different standard of proof. Similarly in 2009 CLC 223, it was observed by the Honourable High Court:---\n  \"After perusal of evidence of P.W.2, P.W.3 and P.W.4 as a whole, the mentioning of date by P.W.3 as 10-8-2000 can be termed as a slip of tongue and the same could not be made basis for outright rejection of the claim of the petitioner\"\n  11. After taking into consideration the evidence of the P.Ws as a whole, I hold that the single sentence is either slip of tongue or a clerical mistake and the plaintiff has -proved the making of Talb-e-Muwathibat through evidence which is consistent and confidence inspiring.\n  12. So far Talb-e-Ishhad is concerned, the learned appellate Court in para.13 of its judgment has held that when Talb-e-Muwathibat is not proved, performance of Talb-e-Ishhad is inconsequential having got no value in the eyes of law. It has been mentioned in the plaint and established in the evidence, and admitted by the appellate Court that notice was prepared and sent by the plaintiff to the defendant but the receipt thereof, by the son or the defendant does not stand established. At the same time, the learned appellate Court has observed, with reference to case-law that receipt of the notice by the defendant is immaterial. The finding of the learned appellate Court that \"to establish the receipt of notice by defendant is not material\" is based on proper appreciation of law as under the law, a pre-emptor is required to establish that notice was prepared and sent to the defendant in accordance with law. A pre-emptor is not required to prove that the same was received by the defendant.\n  13. The upshot of the above discussion is that the finding of the learned Appellate- Court on the relevant issue is not based on proper appreciation of evidence, as such I accept this petition, set aside the impugned judgment/decree of the learned appellate Court and restore that of the learned trial Court with no order as to costs.\n  H.B.T./199/P Petition accepted.",

However, as observed in 2006 SCMR page 4 and 2008 MLD 307 (Lahore), receipt of the notice is immaterial. It is to be noted that when as in the present case Talb-e-Muwathibat is not proved, performance of Talb-e-Ishhad is inconsequential in nature having got no value in the eyes of law. The findings of the learned trial Court on issue No.4 are liable to be reversed in the circumstances\". In para.15, the learned appellate Court has observed that \"in light of what has been discussed above, the appeal in hand is partially accepted to the extent that the respondent has not performed the Talb-e-Muwathibat and Talb-e-Ishhad. The impugned judgment/decree is modified accordingly.\"\r\n  6. I have heard arguments from both sides, considered the same and perused the record with the valuable assistance of the learned counsel for the parties.\r\n  7. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the first appellate Court has materially erred by holding that the petitioner/ plaintiff has failed to establish the performance of Talb-e-Muwathibat and that the evidence has not been appreciated according to the principles laid down for appreciation of evidence in the civil cases. It was further contended that the evidence in the case was perused and evaluated by the learned appellate Court against the principle of appreciation of evidence and as such committed material irregularity; that the appellate Court has erred by picking a single sentence from the statement of P.W.4 petitioner wherein it is so recorded that\r\n  that the sentence can either be a slip of tongue or typographic mistake as the entire evidence is consistent on all material points including that the plaintiff was informed about the sale by Murad Ali; that the petitioner has established his right of pre-emption, cause of action and has complied with all the formalities required under section 13 of the N.-W.F.P. Pre-emption Act. 1987.\r\n  8. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent-defendant submitted that the revisional Court, on reappraisal of evidence, is not required to disturb the finding on a question of fact recorded by the appellant Court. Further that the same cannot be interfered with by the revisional Court under section 115, C.P.C. merely because on reappraisal the revisional Court forms a different opinion about the evidence and that such finding could only be set aside if the same had proceeded upon on misapprehension or had suffered from misreading or non-reading of material piece of evidence on record. The learned counsel further argued that the judgment of the appellate Court is based on proper appreciation of evidence and the suit of the petitioner/plaintiff has rightly been dismissed. However, he was not happy with the finding of the learned appellate Court about Tale-e-Ishhad.\r\n  9. It is the case of the petitioner in plaint as well as in his statement in Court that he was informed by Murad Ali P.W.7 at about 2-00 p.m. about the sale in question in presence of P.W.6 Khalid and Amir Nawaz P.W.5. The said Khalid and Amir Nawaz also appeared in the Court at P.W.5 and P.W.6 while Murad Ali informant appeared as P.W.7. All the three P.Ws supported the stance of the plaintiff on every material aspects. It was only a sentence in the cross-examination of P.W.4 petitioner/plaintiff which has been reproduced in the preceding paras., that led the appellate Court to the conclusion that if the informant had not met the plaintiff on 8-7-2006, how could the plaintiff allege that he was informed by the said informer and consequent upon such information he performed Talb-e-Muwathibat. While holding so, the learned appellate Court has altogether ignored the consistent evidence of the three witnesses, thoroughly cross examined by the other side but nothing contradictor could be brought from them and such evidence could not have been discarded on the basis of a single sentence more particularly when the sentence is totally inconsistent with the evidence produced by the petitioner/plaintiff in this case.\r\n  10 On going through the entire cross-examination of the plaintiff/P.W.4 including the sentence under discussion, the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner seems to be convincing one. This sentence is either a clerical mistake on part of the official who was recording the statement or a slip of tongue on part of P.W.4. In 2007 PLR 768 at page 771 in para.7, it has been observed that the standard of appraisal of evidence in civil cases is different from that applied in criminal cases as both the laws have laid different standard of proof. Similarly in 2009 CLC 223, it was observed by the Honourable High Court:---\r\n  \"After perusal of evidence of P.W.2, P.W.3 and P.W.4 as a whole, the mentioning of date by P.W.3 as 10-8-2000 can be termed as a slip of tongue and the same could not be made basis for outright rejection of the claim of the petitioner\"\r\n  11. After taking into consideration the evidence of the P.Ws as a whole, I hold that the single sentence is either slip of tongue or a clerical mistake and the plaintiff has -proved the making of Talb-e-Muwathibat through evidence which is consistent and confidence inspiring.",

HASSAN RIZVI, J.--- This writ petition filed by Syed Aqdas Abbas petitioner seeks to challenge the validity of order dated 16-4-2009 whereby the learned Judge Family Court, Lahore had directed payment of maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.15,000 for the minor plaintiff/respondent No.2 (Syed Muhammad Irtaza) who was a \"special child.\"\n  2. The ground taken are that the petitioner had not yet submitted his written statement; that his monthly salary was Rs.41,000 and that the interim, maintenance of Rs.15,000 per month was exorbitant. In support of the above submissions, reference was made to Zafar Hussain v. Begum Farzana Nazli and others PLD 2004 Lah. 349, Makhdoom Ali v. Mst. Razia Sultana and others 2007 MLD 41 and Mst. Sitwat Chughtai and another v. Judge Family Court, Lahore and another PLD 2009 Lah. 18.\n  3. After hearing learned counsel for the petitioner and perusing the record, I find that the petitioner did not appear before the learned Judge Family Court unless a proclamation had appeared in the newspaper against him. Under section 9 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, he was obliged to submit his written statement on his appearance in Court. Instead of filing written statement and documents relating to his salary/income, he moved an application under section 7 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 pointing out some technicalities. The disposal of that application took six dates from 19-1-2009 to 4-4-2009. It was on the 7th date that the impugned order was passed by the learned Judge Family Court on 16-4-2009 after hearing the parties.\n  4. If the petitioner/defendant was faithful in prosecuting his remedy before the learned Judge Family Court, he should have submitted written statement and proof as to his salary/income. He did not do so. In para.9 of the impugned order, the learned Judge Family Court observed that the petitioner/defendant was a Professor by profession and his monthly take-home pay was Rs.41,000 per month besides other source of income on the basis of writing of books. The learned Judge also took notice of the fact that Syed Muhammad Irtaza (respondent No.2) was a special child and was under treatment of Dr. Nazir Ahmad Khan.\n  5. In the above circumstances, it is difficult to say that interim maintenance at the rate of Rs.15,000 per month for a special child who was under treatment of Dr. Nazir Ahmad Khan, was exorbitant. In any case, this rate of maintenance shall be adjustable at the time of final determination of the maintenance amount. If the petitioner is mindful of his defence, he should immediately submit his written statement bringing to the Court every proof as to his monthly income etc. I would have no cavil with the proposition that where rate of interim maintenance is palpably exorbitant, the same may be reduced even in writ jurisdiction. However, in the present case, there appears to be no such eventuality. The Legislature in its own wisdom, did not provide any appeal, revision or review against the order relating to interim maintenance. The order of interim maintenance cannot be disturbed in writ jurisdiction unless the same on the fact of it is shown to be exorbitant. The writ petitioner has not paid even a single penny for his retarted son and is instead fighting legal battle uptil the High Court. He did not submit his salary slip either before the trial Court or even before this Court. The reasons recorded by the learned Judge Family Court in the impugned order appear to be sound. The rulings cited being in different situations, were not apt similes. No case for interference in writ jurisdiction with the impugned order dated 16-4-2009 passed by the learned Judge Family Court has been made out.

It was claimed that the said land was in the ownership of the plaintiffs and the same was exchanged with Khasra No.194 owned by Mehtab Ahmed Khan for the convenience of cultivation as a result of family settlement. It was further claimed that the second exchange deed executed by Mehtab Ahmed Khan and Abdul Rehman on 26-10-1986, is illegal, void and inoperative as against the rights of the plaintiffs/appellants, herein. Mehtab Ahmad Khan, also filed a counter suit for declaration and perpetual injunction against Muhammad Ameer Khan and others, appellants, herein, on the ground that he is owner of the land comprising Khasra No.734/450, renumbered as Khasra No.836 measuring 2 Kanals 4 Marlas on the basis of exchange. It was averred by him that the afore-said land was exchanged on 3rd May, 1997 B.K. with Khasra No.194 and mutation No.303 on the basis of the said exchange was also entered in the Revenue Record. After necessary proceedings the learned Senior Civil Judge Rawalakot vide his judgment dated 28-6-2005 dismissed both the suits for want of proof Both the parties felt aggrieved from the judgment of the learned Senior Civil Judge Poonch, and challenged the same through cross appeals. After hearing the parties the learned District Judge, Poonch, accepted the appeal No.54 filed on behalf of Mehtab Ahmed Khan and dismissed the, counter appeal filed by the appellants, herein. The proprietary and legality of this judgment has been challenged by the present appellants through the instant appeal.\n  Sardar Suleman Khan, the learned Advocate for the appellants made following submissions on behalf of the appellants:\n  (1) That the so called mutation and exchange entered on 3rd May, 1999 B.K. was an oral transaction having been executed in violation of the provisions of the Registration Act, hence, confer no title on .the respondents and findings of the learned District Judge are erroneous, illegal and violative of the law. Reliance was placed on sections 54 and 118 of the Transfer of Proper Act and AIR 1928 All. 641.\n  (2) That mutation even otherwise does not create any title, hence, on the basis of mutation nobody could be declared owner of the land, hence, subsequent exchange is also illegal. Reliance was placed on PLD 2007 SC 287.\n  (3) That no suit for declaration on the basis of an oral agreement can be filed and it was enjoined upon the learned District Judge to dismiss the suit of the respondents as has been ruled in 2007 YLR 2228.\n  (4) That the judgment of the learned District judge is telegraphic, does not contain material facts and has been handed down in violation of Order XLI, rule 31 of C.P.C.\n  Sardar Ejaz Ahmad Khan, the learned counsel for the respondents, controverted the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants and submitted that execution of exchange is an admitted fact and in pursuance thereof the parties are also in possession of the exchanged' land. He added that on the basis of this document, record-of-?right has been prepared from time to time and the appellants have not challenged the same at any stage and even in the instant suit, hence, they were not entitled to file a suit for a bare declaration without claiming consequential relief i.e. correction of record-of-rights: He further argued that subsequent gift-deed has also been executed with legal authority and cannot be questioned on any grounds whatsoever. He also contended that the order of mutation would be read as a whole and mere words \"for the convenience of cultivation\" do not, in any manner, destroy the intention of the parties, regarding transfer of title of the exchanged property. He referred to and relied upon 2008 PCr.LJ 633.\n  I have taken into consideration the respective arguments of the learned Advocates for the parties and perused the record of the case.\n  So far as the first contention of Sardar Muhammad Suleman Khan, the learned Advocate for the appellants that exchange is an oral transaction and Mutation No.303 does not confer any title is concerned that is devoid of any force. It is correct that the property worth more than Rs.90 cannot be transferred except through a registered document but fact remains that in Dogra Regime particularly in Poonch State even transfers through registered documents were not valid until the same were not countersigned by the Maharaja. In the instant case it appears that the parties have entered into an oral exchange in order to avoid the above complexity. In my estimation the defect, if any, was stood cured on the promulgation of the Transfer of Land Validation Act, 2003 (B.K.)/1946 A.D. (Act XIV of 2003). This Act was enforced in order to validate the transfers made through unregistered transactions or mutations attested on the oral request of the parties to such transaction.

      "case_proceddings": "Facts necessary for the purpose of decision are that the plaintiffs/appellants, herein, brought a suit for declaration and possession in the Court of Senior Civil Judge, Rawalakot, against the defendants in respect of the land comprising Khasra No.734/450. It was claimed that the said land was in the ownership of the plaintiffs and the same was exchanged with Khasra No.194 owned by Mehtab Ahmed Khan for the convenience of cultivation as a result of family settlement. It was further claimed that the second exchange deed executed by Mehtab Ahmed Khan and Abdul Rehman on 26-10-1986, is illegal, void and inoperative as against the rights of the plaintiffs/appellants, herein. Mehtab Ahmad Khan, also filed a counter suit for declaration and perpetual injunction against Muhammad Ameer Khan and others, appellants, herein, on the ground that he is owner of the land comprising Khasra No.734/450, renumbered as Khasra No.836 measuring 2 Kanals 4 Marlas on the basis of exchange. It was averred by him that the afore-said land was exchanged on 3rd May, 1997 B.K. with Khasra No.194 and mutation No.303 on the basis of the said exchange was also entered in the Revenue Record. After necessary proceedings the learned Senior Civil Judge Rawalakot vide his judgment dated 28-6-2005 dismissed both the suits for want of proof Both the parties felt aggrieved from the judgment of the learned Senior Civil Judge Poonch, and challenged the same through cross appeals. After hearing the parties the learned District Judge, Poonch, accepted the appeal No.54 filed on behalf of Mehtab Ahmed Khan and dismissed the, counter appeal filed by the appellants, herein. The proprietary and legality of this judgment has been challenged by the present appellants through the instant appeal.\r\n  Sardar Suleman Khan, the learned Advocate for the appellants made following submissions on behalf of the appellants:\r\n  (1) That the so called mutation and exchange entered on 3rd May, 1999 B.K. was an oral transaction having been executed in violation of the provisions of the Registration Act, hence, confer no title on .the respondents and findings of the learned District Judge are erroneous, illegal and violative of the law. Reliance was placed on sections 54 and 118 of the Transfer of Proper Act and AIR 1928 All. 641.\r\n  (2) That mutation even otherwise does not create any title, hence, on the basis of mutation nobody could be declared owner of the land, hence, subsequent exchange is also illegal. Reliance was placed on PLD 2007 SC 287.\r\n  (3) That no suit for declaration on the basis of an oral agreement can be filed and it was enjoined upon the learned District Judge to dismiss the suit of the respondents as has been ruled in 2007 YLR 2228.\r\n  (4) That the judgment of the learned District judge is telegraphic, does not contain material facts and has been handed down in violation of Order XLI, rule 31 of C.P.C.\r\n  Sardar Ejaz Ahmad Khan, the learned counsel for the respondents, controverted the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants and submitted that execution of exchange is an admitted fact and in pursuance thereof the parties are also in possession of the exchanged' land. He added that on the basis of this document, record-of-?right has been prepared from time to time and the appellants have not challenged the same at any stage and even in the instant suit, hence, they were not entitled to file a suit for a bare declaration without claiming consequential relief i.e. correction of record-of-rights: He further argued that subsequent gift-deed has also been executed with legal authority and cannot be questioned on any grounds whatsoever. He also contended that the order of mutation would be read as a whole and mere words \"for the convenience of cultivation\" do not, in any manner, destroy the intention of the parties, regarding transfer of title of the exchanged property. He referred to and relied upon 2008 PCr.LJ 633.\r\n  I have taken into consideration the respective arguments of the learned Advocates for the parties and perused the record of the case.\r\n  So far as the first contention of Sardar Muhammad Suleman Khan, the learned Advocate for the appellants that exchange is an oral transaction and Mutation No.303 does not confer any title is concerned that is devoid of any force. It is correct that the property worth more than Rs.90 cannot be transferred except through a registered document but fact remains that in Dogra Regime particularly in Poonch State even transfers through registered documents were not valid until the same were not countersigned by the Maharaja. In the instant case it appears that the parties have entered into an oral exchange in order to avoid the above complexity. In my estimation the defect, if any, was stood cured on the promulgation of the Transfer of Land Validation Act, 2003 (B.K.)/1946 A.D. (Act XIV of 2003). This Act was enforced in order to validate the transfers made through unregistered transactions or mutations attested on the oral request of the parties to such transaction. As such transfers were violative of subsection (1) of section 138 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1977 as was enforced at that time in the State hence, the law was promulgated to validate these transfers. I would like to reproduce the said Act which is as under:--\r\n  \"The Transfer of Land Validation Act, 2003 (BIK)/1946, A.D.

The learned counsel for the petitioner contends that section 17 of the Punjab, Pre-emption Act, 1991 provides as follows:---\n  \"17. Abatement of right of pre-emption.--- (1) Where a pre-emptor, before the decree of a Court, alienates the property on the basis of which he, claims the right of pre-emption, such right shall abate.\n  (2) An alienee of the property under subsection (1) shall not be entitled to the right of pre-emption.\n  The learned counsel submits that where the pre-emptor alienates a part or whole of his property on the basis of which he asserts a right of pre-emption, his right of pre-emption stands abated. He has based his argument on the basis concept of Islamic Law of Pre-emption which is that in exercise of right of pre-emption, the ownership of the pre-emptor in terms of quantum should increase and not decrease.\n  3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent submits that from a perusal of section 17 ibid it is abundantly clear that the intention of the legislature was that the right of pre-emption should abate only in the event the pre-emptor alienates the entire property on the basis of which he asserts a right of pre-emption. He has referred to sections 5. and 6 of the Punjab Pre-emption Act to argue that a right of pre-emption, arises in case of sale of immovable property and vests in three classes mentioned in section 6 of the Pre-emption Act, 1991, namely, Shafi Shariq, Shafi Khalit and Shafi Jar.

A.-G. for Respondent No.2.\n  Date of hearing: 16th June, 2009.\n    JUDGMENT\n  RAJA MUHAMMAD SHAFQAT KHAN ABBASI, J.--Through this writ petition, petitioners have assailed the order, dated 29-1-2001 passed by Member (Judicial-II), Board of Revenue, Punjab whereby he has reviewed the earlier order dated 8-12-1998 passed by another Member, Board of Revenue and remanded the case to the Deputy Commissioner with the direction to pass afresh order regarding the appointment of Lamberdar.\n  2. Brief facts of the case are that Chak No.291/WB, situated in present. Tehsil Dunyapur of District Lodhran consisted of 1589 Acres and there was only one post of Lambardar which was held by a person from Arain Community was in majority. In these circumstances, the petitioner initiated proceedings for creation of second post of Lambardar in the Chak in view of the area of the Chak and deprivation of Majority Community. As a result of the efforts of the petitioner second post of Lambardar was sanctioned for this Chak vide order of Commissioner, Multan Division, Multan dated 8-8-1990. Applications were invited for the post of Lambardar in the above said Chak No.291/WB. Petitioner was appointed as permanent Lambardar by the Deputy Commissioner, Lodhran on 13-3-1993. Khushi Muhammad and one Muhammad Fazal assailed the order of the Deputy Commissioner by filing appeal which was rejected by the learned Commissioner Multan Division on 27-1-1997. Respondent No.1 i.e. Khushi Muhammad filed revision against the order of the Commissioner before, the Board of Revenue which was also dismissed by the Member Judicial-III, Board of Revenue on 8-12-1998. Respondent No.1 filed review petition against order dated 8-12-1998 which was accepted by the respondent No.2 i.e. Member Judicial-II, Board of Revenue, Punjab on 29-1-2009, hence, this writ petition.\n  3. This writ petition was admitted for regular hearing on 9-3-2001. Operation of the impugned order dated 29-1-2001 was suspended. Notices were issued to the respondent No.1 but none has turned up. The process-server, namely, Muzaffar Abbas reported that respondent No.1/Khushi Muhammad was personally served and obtained the thumb-mark of the. Khushi Muhammad and Allah Yar, Lambardar on the notice. Hence, he has been proceeded ex parte.\n  4. Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter alia, contends that case does not fall within the purview of section 8 of the Board of Revenue Act, 1957 for exercise of review powers by the respondent No.2; that there was no ground for review in terms of section 8; that through impugned order concurrent findings of facts recorded by the competent Courts of law were interfered; that alleged ground of interference was regarding holding of land by the respondents; this fact has been agitated in the previous proceedings; that entire holding of the respondent No.1 was mortgaged at the relevant time when the Revenue offices examined and decided the case of appointment of Lambardar in 1992-1993, hence, mere fact that property of the respondent No.1 was redeemed from the mortgage cannot be a ground for interference.\n  5. Arguments heard. Record perused.\n  6. Language used in section 8 of the Act, section 114 and Order XLVII of C.P.C. is synonymous. In order to understand the controversy involved in the matter and scope of review, section 8 of the West Pakistan Board of Revenue Act (XI of 1957) is reproduced here:\n  \"Review of orders by the Board.--- (1) Any person considering himself aggrieved by a decree passed or order made by the Board and who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within .his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order was made or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, desires to obtain a review of the decree passed or order made against him, may apply to the Board for a review of judgment and the Board may, after giving notice to the parties affected thereby and after hearing them, pass such decree or order as the circumstances of the case require.\n  (2) Every application for a review of a decree or order under subsection (1) shall be made within ninety days from the date of that decree order.\"\n  Plain reading of the section indicates that grounds for review are discovery of new and important evidence which was not in the knowledge to the party, such evidence is not produced at the time of the decree or order. Scope of review is very limited. It is not permitted to reopen the matter, jurisdiction of review can only be exercised subject to the conditions mentioned in the statute. It can only be invoked, when new and important matter or evidence is discovered, which was not available on the previous occasion when order was passed or it can be availed, when order was made on account of some mistake or error apparent on the fact of the record. Reliance is placed on Khan Muhammad and others v. Member, Board of Revenue and others PLD 2006 Lah. 615. It is settled principle of law that review cannot be made only for the reason that another view can be taken on the record. It has been held in Muhammad Ashraf v. Dost Muhammad and others 1981 SCMR 383. Sh. Mehdi Hassan v. Province of Punjab through Member, Board of Revenue and 5 others 2007 SCMR 755 that succeeding member though competent to review, cannot review the order passed by his predecessor simply because another view could be taken in the case of Muhammad Amin v. M.B.R. 1992 CLC 2338 it was held that where ground on which review was sought relates to the merits of the case, case could not be permitted to be reopened in exercise of power under section 8 of the Act.\n  In section 8 words \"for any other sufficient reason\" to be read \"ejusdem generic\" (of the same thing or nature) with proceedings words laying down ground of review ... review is not available for every cause but restricted to cause relatable to circumstances as discovery of view an important matter or some apparent mistake on face of record. Requirement of review is that some errors must be so manifest and so. clear that no Court to permit such errors to remain on the record and it must be error, which must be floating on the surface of the record. Reliance is placed on Muhammad Din and 2 others v. Muhammad Amin and 8 others PLD 1994 SC 288, Khan Muhammad and others v. Member, Board of Revenue and others, PTD 2006 Lah. 615 and Nasim Ahmad v. Board of Revenue PLD 1979 Note 82 at P.57 in present case.\n  7. Admittedly petitioner was appointed as Lambardar by the Deputy Commissioner vide order, dated 13-3-1993 which indicates that he has visited the Chak and conducted inquiry proceeding in open assembly of the inhabitants which shows that he has taken meticulous care in the matter. Order of the Deputy Commissioner was upheld by the Commissioner vide order dated 27-1-1997 and Board of Revenue on 8-12-1998. These findings recorded by the officers of the revenue hierarchy were interfered by the respondent No.2/Member, Board of Revenue in exercise of a review jurisdiction. Highest hierarchy of the revenue department have appointed petitioner as Lambardar and gave findings of fact, which was interfered through impugned order without any legal justification. Impugned order passed by respondent No.2 is not only violative of law as well as the established principle laid down by the august Supreme Court. This Court can correct any error on the part of the revenue officer. I am guided by the dictum laid down in a case titled as Naik Muhammad v. Mazhar Ali and others 2007 SCMR 112 and Muhammad Yousaf v. Member, Board of Revenue and 4 others 1996 SCMR 1581. It has been held in case of Haji Noor PLD 1991 SC 531 it has been observed as follows:---\n  \"The Board of Revenue at the apex of the Revenue hierarchy is charged with the statutory duty of interpreting the law, of applying it to individual cases coming up before it and laying down the law for the subordinate in the hierarchy to follow. Any error on its part in understanding the law, in applying it or in laying down the law can and must be corrected in the constitutional jurisdiction. If it is left uncorrected, it will result in subverting the rule of law.\"\n  8. The upshot of the above discussion is that this writ petition is allowed, order dated 29-11-2001 passed by the Member (Judl-III), Board of Revenue, Punjab this review is set aside, resultantly, order dated 8-12-1998 passed by the Member Board of Revenue in revision petition is restored. Parties will bear their cost.\n  H.B.T./A-275/L Petition allowed.",

The same was assailed in appeal which was dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge on 30-9-2009.\n  2. Detailed facts of the case have been given in the petition as well as the plaint and need not be reproduced in extenso. However, a brief summary is being given in order to appreciate the controversy before this Court. The petitioner filed a suit against respondent No.1 for a declaration to the effect that he was the only legal heir of Muhammad Yaqoob son of Khawaja. He was, therefore, exclusively entitled to own a piece of land measuring 21 Kanals, 3 Marlas situated at Chak No.248/RB, Tehsil and District Faisalabad. A further declaration was sought that respondent No.1, being an adopted daughter of Muhammad Yaqoob, was not a legal heir and was not entitled to inherit any share in the property.\n  3. The suit was contested. The learned trial Court framed as many as six issues, out of which issue No.1 was the most material. The same is reproduced as follows:---\n  (1) Whether the plaintiff is the sole legal heir of the deceased Muhammad Yaqoob and the defendant No.1 is the adopted daughter of the deceased? OPP.\n  4. The onus to prove the afore-said issue was on the plaintiff. The plaintiff adduced evidence to prove the same. The petitioner did not take the witness box in support of his case. The witnesses produced by him stated that respondent No.1 was not the real sister of the petitioner. In fact the real sister of the petitioner had died on her way to Pakistan at the time of Partition. Respondent No.1 had been adopted by the parents of the petitioner and there was no other legal heir.\n  5. The controversy had arisen on account of Mutation No.1043 which was attested in favour of the petitioner on the basis of a statement made by him before the Revenue authorities on 1-1-1989. In the said statement the petitioner had stated that his sister Sharifan Bibi had died six months ago and being the sole surviving legal heir of Muhammad Yaqoob he was entitled to the entire property. On the basis of the said statement, it appears, that Mutation No.1043 was attested in his favour on 9-1-1989.\n  6. As opposed to the aforesaid statement the position taken in paragraph 2 of the plaint was that the petitioner's sister namely Sharifan Bibi had died at the time of partition. There was, however, no plausible explanation forthcoming as to how a mutation Exh.P.5 had earlier been sanctioned in favour of the successors of Muhammad Yaqoob who were identified as Hajran Bibi (widow), Bashir Ahmad (son/petitioner) and Sharifan Bibi alias Hanifan Bibi (daughter).\n  7. At the closing stages of the trial an affidavit allegedly sworn by Hajiran Bibi in 1989 was placed on record in the statement of the learned counsel for the plaintiff. In the said affidavit Hajiran Bibi had allegedly stated that respondent No.1 was not her daughter. The said document was never proved in accordance with law nor was it admissible in evidence. The author of the document was never subjected to the test of cross examination. Therefore, no reliance could be placed on the said document as correctly held by the subordinate Courts.\n  8. During the proceedings Exh.P-13 was produced which is the Nikahnama of respondent No.1. In the said document respondent No.1 is shown as the daughter of Muhammad Yaqoob and, amongst others, it is attested by the petitioner. An attempt was made to argue that Sharifan Bibi alias Hanifan Bibi are actually two persons. Therefore, the Nikahnama and the entire appearing therein do not provide any benefit to respondent No.1. It is, however, evident from a perusal of Exh. P.5 that Sharifan Bibi alias Hanifan Bibi is the same person, namely, respondent No.1.\n  9. It has also come on record that the petitioner filed at least four different suits in an attempt to prove that respondent No.1 was not the daughter of Muhammad Yaqoob and hence not entitled to any share in his property as his legal heir. The said suits were, for one reason or the other, withdrawn.\n  10. On the basis of the aforesaid material available on record both the lower Courts came to the conclusion that the petitioner had failed to discharge the onus of proof placed on him relating to the first and the most material issue reproduced above. He failed to appear in person in support of his case. The evidence produced by him was contradictory insofar as in paragraph 2 of the plaint he took the position that his sister had died at the time of partition while in the statement made by him before the Revenue authorities to get Mutation No.1043 sanctioned in his favour, he stated that his sister had died six months ago. Further the fact that he attested the Nikahnama of respondent No.1 in which the name of the father of respondent was mentioned as Muhammad Yaqoob estopped him for taking a different position. The affidavit of Hajiran Bibi Exh.P.14 was clearly an afterthought and a futile attempt to improve the case of the petitioner.\n  11 The learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that the reliance of the lower Courts on the statement made by the petitioner before the Revenue authorities and the fact of his attestation of the Nikahnama was misplaced. He further submits that the evidence produced by the petitioner by way of oral as well as documentary evidence was not given its due weight and seen in its true perspective. Therefore, the impugned judgments suffer from the defect of misreading and non-reading of evidence.\n  12. I have heard 'the learned counsel at length. I have gone through the evidence as well as orders of the learned subordinate Courts. The evidence produced by the petitioner was contradictory not supported by material on record and did not inspire confidence. The fact that the petitioner did not appear in person to support his case, made false and contradictory statements at various stages of various rounds of litigation between the parties and the fact that he attested the respondent's Nikahnama in which the name of the respondent's father was mentioned as Muhammad Yaqoob, played a major role in his failure to discharge the onus of proof placed on him.\n  13. The petitioner failed to prove that he was the only legal heir of Muhammad Yaqoob and that the respondent was not the real daughter of Muhammad Yaqoob. All documentary evidence including Exh. P.5 (mutation) and Exh.P.11 (Nikahnama) supported the fact that respondent No.1 was the daughter of Muhammad Yaqoob. The alleged affidavit of Hajiran Bibi, the mother of the parties was never proved and has no evidentiary value. In order to be read in evidence, a document must' be proved in accordance with the requirements of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. This was admittedly not done. Therefore, it was rightly not given any weight. There is a higher threshold of the quality of evidence required to deprive a person of his/her rights in inherited property especially so where rights of women are involved. Such threshold has clearly not been achieved in this case.\n  14. The learned subordinate Courts correctly appraised and appreciated the evidence placed on record, arrived at the right conclusions and the orders passed by both subordinate Courts are well reasoned and in accordance with law. The learned counsel has not been able to show any misreading or non-reading of evidence nor has any illegality or material irregularity on the part of the learned Subordinate Courts been demonstrated before me. I do not find any merit in the petition. It is, accordingly, dismissed in limine.\n  M.U.Y./B-51/L Petition dismissed.",

The said suits were, for one reason or the other, withdrawn.\r\n  10. On the basis of the aforesaid material available on record both the lower Courts came to the conclusion that the petitioner had failed to discharge the onus of proof placed on him relating to the first and the most material issue reproduced above. He failed to appear in person in support of his case. The evidence produced by him was contradictory insofar as in paragraph 2 of the plaint he took the position that his sister had died at the time of partition while in the statement made by him before the Revenue authorities to get Mutation No.1043 sanctioned in his favour, he stated that his sister had died six months ago. Further the fact that he attested the Nikahnama of respondent No.1 in which the name of the father of respondent was mentioned as Muhammad Yaqoob estopped him for taking a different position. The affidavit of Hajiran Bibi Exh.P.14 was clearly an afterthought and a futile attempt to improve the case of the petitioner.\r\n  11 The learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that the reliance of the lower Courts on the statement made by the petitioner before the Revenue authorities and the fact of his attestation of the Nikahnama was misplaced. He further submits that the evidence produced by the petitioner by way of oral as well as documentary evidence was not given its due weight and seen in its true perspective. Therefore, the impugned judgments suffer from the defect of misreading and non-reading of evidence.\r\n  12. I have heard 'the learned counsel at length. I have gone through the evidence as well as orders of the learned subordinate Courts. The evidence produced by the petitioner was contradictory not supported by material on record and did not inspire confidence. The fact that the petitioner did not appear in person to support his case, made false and contradictory statements at various stages of various rounds of litigation between the parties and the fact that he attested the respondent's Nikahnama in which the name of the respondent's father was mentioned as Muhammad Yaqoob, played a major role in his failure to discharge the onus of proof placed on him.\r\n  ",

The brief facts narrated in this petition are that the petitioner was a student of M.Sc. course `Stat-700 \"Elements of Statistics and Biometry\" and appeared in the original examination in Winter 2005-2006 in which he failed. Then the petitioner appeared in Spring 2005-2006 and failed and the third time he appeared as per rules for the second repetition for Spring Semesters 2006-2007 in which he appeared in the first paper on 8-8-2007. The petitioner was rusticated with the allegation that he had beaten fellow student with the help of outsiders on 5-6-2007. When the petitioner was rusticated the Spring Session was going on and the petitioner had already appeared in the first appear and had to appear in two papers but due to the order passed on 8-8-2007 by the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad he did not remain the student of the University and was not in a position to appear for the remaining two papers. The said order was challenged by the petitioner by filing an appeal and the appellate authority set aside the sentence of the petitioner and converted the same into following sentences:---\n  (1) Fined Rs.7,000.\n  (2) Placed on probation for the rest of his stay in the University.\n  (3) He will submit a surety bond within ten days on judicial paper worth Rs.100 to the Director Students' Affairs duly signed by him, his father/guardian that he will refrain from 'activities antagonistic to good conduct and discipline during his remaining study period at the University.\n  The petitioner was fined Rs.7,000, placed on probation for the rest of his stay in the University and was also directed to submit surety bond within two days on judicial paper worth Rs.100 to the Director Students' Affairs duly signed by him, his father/guardian that he will refrain from activities antagonistic to good conduct and discipline during his remaining study period at the University.\n  3. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that due to the sentence awarded through the original order he could not appear in two papers of Spring Sessions 2006-2007 and made a request to the University to allow him to appear in the remaining two papers but the request was declined; that then the petitioner appeared in the examination being held in Spring 2007-2008 in which the petitioner failed. Now the grievance of the petitioner is that he was not allowed to avail the chance of third attempt and second repetition in which the petitioner could not appear due to the order of rustication passed against him having no fault and now the university is not allowing the petitioner to appear for the said chance which has been wasted due to rustication. It is also contended that it is by fourth repetition. It was the third repetition in which the petitioner has failed while the second repetition and the petitioner has been wasted due .to the order of rustication and the petitioner may be allowed to avail another chance for second repetition which was wasted.\n  5. Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand had opposed this petition and contends that the writ petition is not maintainable as the petitioner earlier filed a civil suit in which stay was not granted to the petitioner and he filed this writ petition. Filing of the suit was also admitted by the petitioner in his writ petition and he has also placed on the record copy of civil suit which is Annexure \"D\". When the writ petition was filed the civil suit was pending and copy has been placed on the record by the petitioner which is at page 25 through which stay order has been refused to the petitioner by the Civil Court.\n  6. It is also contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner in rebuttal that as the petitioner had been enrolled for Spring Semesters 2006-2007, it will be considered that the chance had been availed by the petitioner and he failed in Spring 2007-2008, but he was not allowed to appear in the papers for Spring 2006-2007 due to rustication order, which was set aside and the petitioner is entitled to avail the chance there against. Relies on PLD 1971 SC 130 and PLD 1988 Lah. 325 in support of his contentions.\n  7. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also perused the record as also the impugned order. From the perusal of the case-law it is clear that even during the pendency of the civil suit writ petition can be maintained and can be decided so this objection is over-ruled. As far as merits of the case are concerned it is not denied by the University that the petitioner had appeared in original examination which was held in Winter 2005-2006 in which he failed. Then he repeated first time in Spring 2005-2006 in which he failed and third time he was enrolled for repetition in the Spring Semester 2006-2007 but could not appear due to rustication order passed against the petitioner which was subsequently set aside by the appellate forum.

In such circumstances the, second repetition will be considered when the petitioner appeared in Spring 2007-2008 as it was beyond the control of the petitioner due to the orders passed by the University through which he was rusticated and he ceased to be the student of the University.

In the third week of April, 2005 both the sisters married to the two brothers. Hardly a year passed that their relations reached a point that both the sisters had to leave their matrimonial homes and return back to their brothers' house. They then in the year, 2006 filed suit for dissolution of marriage by way of \"Khula\" and return of dowry articles. The suits were decreed and Khula was granted.\n  2. These two petitions have been filed by the two brothers against the said orders passed by the Family Judge, Karachi (East) in Family Suit No.1865 of 2006 and Family Suit No.1404 of 2006 granting Khula to the two sisters.\n  3. The learned counsel for the petitioner at the very outset argued that in order to obtain a decree of Khula from the Court of their own choice, the two sisters filed suits for dissolution of marriage by giving address of Gulistan-e-Jauhar that falls within the limits of District (East), Karachi whereas their actual place of residence is in Nazimabad, which falls within the limits of District (Central), Karachi. The second ground that has been urged by the learned counsel is that the question whether Court can grant Khula was sub judice before the Federal Shariat Court, which though has decided the matter but an appeal against such decision has been preferred and therefore this Court may not proceed with the matter until the Shariat Appellate Bench finally decides the pending controversy on \"Khula\".\n  4. In support of his first contention, that suits for dissolution of marriage were not filed in the Courts within those jurisdiction the two sisters reside, the learned counsel for the petitioners has referred to the address given on the title of the suit in which the address has been shown to be of Gulistan-e-Jauhar whereas in the Nikahnama the place of residence of the two sisters is of Nazimabad. The learned counsel further states that after obtaining preliminary decree in the first case the letter to reconciliation committee was written at the same address of Nazimabad that was given in Nikahnama which clearly shows that the place of residence of the two sisters was always Nazimabad and never been in Gulistan-e-Johar as was shown in the plaint.\n  5. In reply to the first contention, the learned counsel for the respondent No.1 has argued that the respondent No.1 has two brothers, one living in Gulistan-e-Jauhar and the other in Nazimabad and at the time of filing of the suit the two sisters were living with their other brother who lives in Gulistan-e-Jauhar therefore there was no misrepresentation, fraud or any ill intention in showing Gulistan-e-Jauhar's address as their place of residence.\n  6. It is not the case of the petitioners that the residential address that was shown on the plaints was of someone else and not of the two sisters or their brother. There is no categorical plea in this regard in the written statements that two sisters were not residing at the address of Gulistan-e-Jauhar. Mere a plea has been taken that the Court has no jurisdiction, which would not be enough to hold that the Court in which suit was filed had not jurisdiction to try the suit. Furthermore, now that decision has been finally given on merits and nothing was brought on record to establish that Gulistan-e-Jauhar address was not the place of residence of the two sisters, what needs to be examined is whether there was any legal infirmity in the decisions. If there is no legal infirmity then their validity cannot be doubted on a vague plea that suit was filed before a Court having no jurisdiction which is not supported by clear and unambiguous material.\n  7. Insofar as the merits of the case are concerned, the case of the two sisters is that after contracting marriage, the petitioners have not only been abusing them but they have also been physically harming them on petty issues. Thus they blamed their husbands for humiliation and maltreatment which left no other alternative for them but to seek \"Khula\".\n  8. During pendency of the proceedings the operation of the impugned judgment was stayed till the disposal of the petition filed by the petitioner before the Federal Shariat Court. The Federal Shariat Court vide its decision dated 28-5-2009 disposed of the petition, the findings thereof are very clear, hence there is now no legal impediment to decide these petitions.\n  9. In the case before the Federal Shariat Court the case of the petitioner was that subsection (4) to section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, is repugnant to the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).\n  10. The case of the petitioners before the Federal Shariat Court was that \"Khula' can only be granted to the wife if the husband consents to it and no Court has the authority to order dissolution of marriage by way of Khula if the husband does not agree to it. On this issue it is worthwhile to reproduce following excerpts from the judgment of the Federal Shariat Court given on 28-5-2009 in Shariat Petition No.1/K of 2007: ---\n  (11) \"Hence we may mention that although the marriage has a moral, legal and spiritual bearing on the parties and is publicly sanctified or a \"Khutba\", in the presence of witnesses and is rightly considered a Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), it is not a sacrament; it is not irrevocable but; in essence, it is civil contract between husband and wife which creates mutual rights and obligations. This contract is a life long commitment, meant to last happily for the whole life between husband and wife, as hinted at by the Qura'nic Verse, calling it \"a firm pledge\" (4:21). The main purpose referred to by another Qura'nic Verse (30:21) is love, peace and tranquility and therefore both the spouses are expected and required to maintain cordial, harmonious and loveable relations. For this purpose various instructions have been given by the Holy Qur'an. It has ordained \"Live with your wives gracefully\" (4:19). In continuation of the same it has highlighted the importance of tolerance and peaceful coexistence, it says: \"if you dislike them in any manner, it may be that you dislike something in which Allah has placed much good\" (4:19).\n  (12) Both the spouses have mutual rights and obligation and, as a matter of right, must enjoy the same, having regard to the moral, social and ethical values, as has been unambiguously advised in the verses mentioned herein above.\n  (13) However, there are always ups and downs in the mutual relations between the spouses. At time the relations become so strained that the spouses feel unable to maintain a happy peaceful union within the limits prescribed by Almighty Allah and His Messenger (2:229). In such circumstances it has been directed that:--\n  \"If you fear a,breach between the two (i.e. husband and wife), appoint an arbitrator from his people and an arbitrator from her people; if they both want to set things right Allah will bring about reconciliation between them.- Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware\" (4:35).\"\n  . The arbitration to bring about peace between the spouses may not succeed. The reconciliation efforts may fail altogether and the spouses, resultantly, may come to a dead lock. Then naturally both the spouses are allowed to terminate the contract entered into earlier by their mutual consent. According to Islamic injunctions the marital contract,' in circumstances, can be dissolved either by the husband arbitrarily, on his own initiative, or at the instance of the wife, on the basis of Khula, or by mutual agreement. In all these options there are certain conditions to be followed. However, the spouses have been reminded to keep in mind that both divorce and \"Khula\" are most undesirable options and are allowed only when they genuinely come to the conclusion that continuation of their union is harmful, making them unable to perform their mutual obligations amicably enough to live within the bounds prescribed by Almighty Allah The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) while referring to Divorce is reported to have said that the most detestable of lawful things in Allah 's view is divorce.\n  (14) Be that as may, a marriage may be dissolved not only by Talaq (divorce) which is the arbitrary act of the husband, but also by mutual agreement of the spouses which is called \"Mubarat\". Likewise it can be dissolved at the instance of the wife in which case she gives or agrees to give a consideration to the husband for her release from the marriage tie. Termination of the marriage by way of Talaq or Khula are the unanimously recognized ways of the dissolution of marriage and continuously being followed since the period of Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) till date, whenever occasions demanding the same have arisen. Normally, extra judicial divorce is preferred in Islam to save the spouses from unnecessary litigations. Islam rightly expects the Muslims to be God fearing responsible and mature enough to act wisely and judiciously. However, all people are not alike. The aggrieved spouses may not be reasonable. Therefore, in this connection, a question regarding the exercise of the right of \"Khula\" by the wife has been agitated to the effect that whether dissolution of marriage when asked, at the instance of wife can be decreed by a Qazi himself or even then also, it would be subject to the approval of her husband.\n  (15) The majority of learned counsel for petitioners as well as of the Jurist Consults contended that dissolution of marriage by way of Khula can be effected only by an offer from the wife to compensate the husband if he releases her from his marital tie, and acceptance by the husband of the offer. In their opinion a Qazi before whom prayer for dissolution of marriage is made is not authorized to decree in her favour if the husband is unwilling to accept the offer. This means that the husband has an upper hand in the matter throughout and the wife unless allowed and divorced by the husband, or her demand for Khula before a Qazi, has still to continue in his wedlock forever.\n  The proviso of section 10(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964 has made` it binding on the Court to pass a decree in case reconciliation fails at pre-trial stage without recording the evidence in the matter which is against the Injunction of Holy Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) as without producing any evidence in respect of liking and disliking on the basis of which the compromise is refused during the pre-trial proceedings the Family Court is bound to pass a decree for dissolution of marriage.\"\n  (18) The word \"Khula\" literally means \"to put off\". In the context of verse which states \"They are garments for you and you are garments for them\". It denotes laying down by the husband of rights and authority over his wife, at her instance, on acceptance of consideration by means of the word \"Khula\" ..But a question arises if the husband does not agree to this arrangement and refuses to release her from his marital tie by not accepting any compensation even and also declines to divorce her, what should be the course of action for the wife? What would she do if reconciliation, fails and the husband proves adamant not to dissolve the marriage? Will it be justified to leave the wife who cannot live happily or perform her marital obligations grope in the darkness? Should she be pushed back to her husband to remain tongue tied, tight--lipped, depressed, dejected, having a miserable survival throughout her whole life? Should she be kept, at the mercy of her in-laws, vulnerable to indecent immoral life? Can anyone call this sort of situation morally justified on any standard? Will this position assigned to her not defeat the very object of marital peace and tranquility? Who will be considered responsible if she cannot bear the mental agony in this state of affair and put an end to her life by setting herself on fire or adopt any other method for committing suicide, which is our normal observation, off and on, in different parts of the country? Who will stop or what will prevent her to administer poison to her husband if she finds herself entangled in a \"holy dead lock\"?.........As mentioned above \"Justice for all\" is the essence social teachings of Islam. No one is to be harmed.\n  It has been declared that \"Let no harm be inflicted nor suffered in Islam\". The Holy Qur'an has repeatedly stressed the husband's duty to keep the wife with kindness. It has been directed to keep them in good fellowship or let them go with grace (2:229). At another place it has been asked the husband to \"retain them in kindness or set them free with kindness\" (2:231). The husbands have been ordered not to retain them (unjustly) for injury and not to exceed the limits (2:231). \"Treat them with grace and kindness\" (4:19) is a command and it has been obeyed in letter and spirit. These pieces of command are not mere instructions or admonitions to be left to the sweet will of the husband only. An Islamic State is bound to implement them through suitable legislation so that it is ensured that none of the spouses is harmed or treated unjustly. It is duty-bound to constitute proper judicial forums where every one gets justice and where grievances are properly redressed. Obviously Islam does not intend to force a wife live a miserable life, in a hateful unhappy union, forever. If she is unhappy and reconciliation fails, she should be entitled to get relief whatsoever. This is what justice demand. This is referred to in the verse. \"Women shall have rights similar to the right against them, according to what is equitable\" (2:228).\n  They (Men) can directly exercise their right of divorce without any recourse to Court of law whereas in case of `Khula' the wife has to seek indulgence of the Court, if her husband does not agree to her demand of `Khula'. The course of judicial process provides an opportunity to the wife to thoroughly consider pros and cons of her demand for `Khula'.\n  Both wife and husband are provided opportunity to consider .and reconsider their course of action and both have to bear financial liability if they insist on separation. No one has any superiority over the other in respect of their rights and responsibilities.\n  The upshot of the above discussion is that there is no specific verse or authentic Ahadith that provides a bar to the exercise of jurisdiction by a competent Qazi to decree the case of Khula agitated before him by a wife, after reconciliation fails. As discussed above in detail, the Ayaat and Ahadith relied upon by the petitioners neither specifically relate to the issue of Khula or to the lack of authority of a Qazi duly authorized by an Islamic State to resolve the disputes between husband and wife. The interpretation of the said Verses and Ahadith is also not unanimous.\n  11. From the above discourse in the judgment of the Federal Shariat Court, it is evident that the wife has a right to seek Khula from her husband through a Court of law in case the relations are strained to such an extent where they become irreconcilable. In the present case the two sisters have expressed their irretrievable position that they could no more live in peace and harmony with the petitioners and on such basis the Family Courts have granted Khula to them. Therefore, this Court finds no legal justification to interfere with the findings of the Courts below: Consequently, both the petitions are dismissed in limine.\n  S.A.K./M 186/K Petitions dismissed.",

      "case_proceddings": "2. These two petitions have been filed by the two brothers against the said orders passed by the Family Judge, Karachi (East) in Family Suit No.1865 of 2006 and Family Suit No.1404 of 2006 granting Khula to the two sisters.\r\n  3. The learned counsel for the petitioner at the very outset argued that in order to obtain a decree of Khula from the Court of their own choice, the two sisters filed suits for dissolution of marriage by giving address of Gulistan-e-Jauhar that falls within the limits of District (East), Karachi whereas their actual place of residence is in Nazimabad, which falls within the limits of District (Central), Karachi. The second ground that has been urged by the learned counsel is that the question whether Court can grant Khula was sub judice before the Federal Shariat Court, which though has decided the matter but an appeal against such decision has been preferred and therefore this Court may not proceed with the matter until the Shariat Appellate Bench finally decides the pending controversy on \"Khula\".\r\n  4. In support of his first contention, that suits for dissolution of marriage were not filed in the Courts within those jurisdiction the two sisters reside, the learned counsel for the petitioners has referred to the address given on the title of the suit in which the address has been shown to be of Gulistan-e-Jauhar whereas in the Nikahnama the place of residence of the two sisters is of Nazimabad. The learned counsel further states that after obtaining preliminary decree in the first case the letter to reconciliation committee was written at the same address of Nazimabad that was given in Nikahnama which clearly shows that the place of residence of the two sisters was always Nazimabad and never been in Gulistan-e-Johar as was shown in the plaint.\r\n  5. In reply to the first contention, the learned counsel for the respondent No.1 has argued that the respondent No.1 has two brothers, one living in Gulistan-e-Jauhar and the other in Nazimabad and at the time of filing of the suit the two sisters were living with their other brother who lives in Gulistan-e-Jauhar therefore there was no misrepresentation, fraud or any ill intention in showing Gulistan-e-Jauhar's address as their place of residence.\r\n  6. It is not the case of the petitioners that the residential address that was shown on the plaints was of someone else and not of the two sisters or their brother. There is no categorical plea in this regard in the written statements that two sisters were not residing at the address of Gulistan-e-Jauhar. Mere a plea has been taken that the Court has no jurisdiction, which would not be enough to hold that the Court in which suit was filed had not jurisdiction to try the suit. Furthermore, now that decision has been finally given on merits and nothing was brought on record to establish that Gulistan-e-Jauhar address was not the place of residence of the two sisters, what needs to be examined is whether there was any legal infirmity in the decisions. If there is no legal infirmity then their validity cannot be doubted on a vague plea that suit was filed before a Court having no jurisdiction which is not supported by clear and unambiguous material.\r\n  7. Insofar as the merits of the case are concerned, the case of the two sisters is that after contracting marriage, the petitioners have not only been abusing them but they have also been physically harming them on petty issues. Thus they blamed their husbands for humiliation and maltreatment which left no other alternative for them but to seek \"Khula\".\r\n  8. During pendency of the proceedings the operation of the impugned judgment was stayed till the disposal of the petition filed by the petitioner before the Federal Shariat Court. The Federal Shariat Court vide its decision dated 28-5-2009 disposed of the petition, the findings thereof are very clear, hence there is now no legal impediment to decide these petitions.\r\n  9. In the case before the Federal Shariat Court the case of the petitioner was that subsection (4) to section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, is repugnant to the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).\r\n  10. The case of the petitioners before the Federal Shariat Court was that \"Khula' can only be granted to the wife if the husband consents to it and no Court has the authority to order dissolution of marriage by way of Khula if the husband does not agree to it. On this issue it is worthwhile to reproduce following excerpts from the judgment of the Federal Shariat Court given on 28-5-2009 in Shariat Petition No.1/K of 2007: ---\r\n  (11) \"Hence we may mention that although the marriage has a moral, legal and spiritual bearing on the parties and is publicly sanctified or a \"Khutba\", in the presence of witnesses and is rightly considered a Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), it is not a sacrament; it is not irrevocable but; in essence, it is civil contract between husband and wife which creates mutual rights and obligations. This contract is a life long commitment, meant to last happily for the whole life between husband and wife, as hinted at by the Qura'nic Verse, calling it \"a firm pledge\" (4:21). The main purpose referred to by another Qura'nic Verse (30:21) is love, peace and tranquility and therefore both the spouses are expected and required to maintain cordial, harmonious and loveable relations. For this purpose various instructions have been given by the Holy Qur'an. It has ordained \"Live with your wives gracefully\" (4:19). In continuation of the same it has highlighted the importance of tolerance and peaceful coexistence, it says: \"if you dislike them in any manner, it may be that you dislike something in which Allah has placed much good\" (4:19).\r\n  (12) Both the spouses have mutual rights and obligation and, as a matter of right, must enjoy the same, having regard to the moral, social and ethical values, as has been unambiguously advised in the verses mentioned herein above.\r\n  (13) However, there are always ups and downs in the mutual relations between the spouses. At time the relations become so strained that the spouses feel unable to maintain a happy peaceful union within the limits prescribed by Almighty Allah and His Messenger (2:229). In such circumstances it has been directed that:--\r\n  \"If you fear a,breach between the two (i.e. husband and wife), appoint an arbitrator from his people and an arbitrator from her people; if they both want to set things right Allah will bring about reconciliation between them.- Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware\" (4:35).\"\r\n  . The arbitration to bring about peace between the spouses may not succeed. The reconciliation efforts may fail altogether and the spouses, resultantly, may come to a dead lock. Then naturally both the spouses are allowed to terminate the contract entered into earlier by their mutual consent. According to Islamic injunctions the marital contract,' in circumstances, can be dissolved either by the husband arbitrarily, on his own initiative, or at the instance of the wife, on the basis of Khula, or by mutual agreement. In all these options there are certain conditions to be followed. However, the spouses have been reminded to keep in mind that both divorce and \"Khula\" are most undesirable options and are allowed only when they genuinely come to the conclusion that continuation of their union is harmful, making them unable to perform their mutual obligations amicably enough to live within the bounds prescribed by Almighty Allah The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) while referring to Divorce is reported to have said that the most detestable of lawful things in Allah 's view is divorce.\r\n  (14) Be that as may, a marriage may be dissolved not only by Talaq (divorce) which is the arbitrary act of the husband, but also by mutual agreement of the spouses which is called \"Mubarat\". Likewise it can be dissolved at the instance of the wife in which case she gives or agrees to give a consideration to the husband for her release from the marriage tie. Termination of the marriage by way of Talaq or Khula are the unanimously recognized ways of the dissolution of marriage and continuously being followed since the period of Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) till date, whenever occasions demanding the same have arisen. Normally, extra judicial divorce is preferred in Islam to save the spouses from unnecessary litigations. Islam rightly expects the Muslims to be God fearing responsible and mature enough to act wisely and judiciously. However, all people are not alike. The aggrieved spouses may not be reasonable. Therefore, in this connection, a question regarding the exercise of the right of \"Khula\" by the wife has been agitated to the effect that whether dissolution of marriage when asked, at the instance of wife can be decreed by a Qazi himself or even then also, it would be subject to the approval of her husband.\r\n  (15) The majority of learned counsel for petitioners as well as of the Jurist Consults contended that dissolution of marriage by way of Khula can be effected only by an offer from the wife to compensate the husband if he releases her from his marital tie, and acceptance by the husband of the offer. In their opinion a Qazi before whom prayer for dissolution of marriage is made is not authorized to decree in her favour if the husband is unwilling to accept the offer. This means that the husband has an upper hand in the matter throughout and the wife unless allowed and divorced by the husband, or her demand for Khula before a Qazi, has still to continue in his wedlock forever.\r\n  The proviso of section 10(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964 has made` it binding on the Court to pass a decree in case reconciliation fails at pre-trial stage without recording the evidence in the matter which is against the Injunction of Holy Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) as without producing any evidence in respect of liking and disliking on the basis of which the compromise is refused during the pre-trial proceedings the Family Court is bound to pass a decree for dissolution of marriage.\"\r\n  (18) The word \"Khula\" literally means \"to put off\". In the context of verse which states \"They are garments for you and you are garments for them\". It denotes laying down by the husband of rights and authority over his wife, at her instance, on acceptance of consideration by means of the word \"Khula\" ..But a question arises if the husband does not agree to this arrangement and refuses to release her from his marital tie by not accepting any compensation even and also declines to divorce her, what should be the course of action for the wife?

No.150 of 2009 and S.A.O. No.151 of 2009 as common questions of law and facts are involved in these appeals.\n  2. The appeals are directed against judgment and decree passed by the learned Civil Judge at Sialkot on 20-6-2009, whereby the appellants were evicted from the premises under their occupation as tenants. The appellants were in possession of Shops Nos.4 and 5 in a premises which was initially owned by the father of respondent No.1 and after his demise had devolved upon the respondents. It is common ground between the parties that it was an oral tenancy and no written document in this regard was produced before the learned trial Court. Although various grounds were taken in the suit for ejectment filed by the respondent No.1 including default, damage to the premises, expiry of lease period etc. the main ground for seeking eviction was bona fide personal need of the landlord.\n  3. The suits were contested. The learned trial Court framed as many as eight issues. On behalf of the respondents, respondent No.1 appeared as a witness in support of the case and produced Ali Akbar as P.W.2. The petitioner appeared as a defence witness and produced five other witnesses including the post man to establish that there was no default and that the premises in question was not required by the landlord on account of personal need.\n  4. The issue of default was not proved 'before the learned trial Court. It was not seriously contested in the appeal either. In support of the issue relating to personal need, respondent No.1 stated that two of his brothers were working in Lahore and Kuwait, and the family was running a business of electronics. They wished to set up a large show room for electronics by combining four shops. They had already got two shops vacated and needed the other two (subject matter of the present appeals) to complete the show room where the respondent's brothers could set up their electronics business on their return. Respondent No.1 was cross-examined. The petitioners could not bring anything on record to convince the learned subordinate Courts that the shops in question were not required by way of personal need. The only material placed on record was certain documents relating to suit filed in 2004 by respondent No.1 against some other tenant relating to some other shop, which had been withdrawn in terms of a compromise where under the tenant had agreed to increase the rent by 100%. On the basis of the said record it was argued that the suit against the appellants was also a device to enhance rent and that there was no bona fide personal need. The said evidence did not find favour with the learned lower Courts who held that the said fact did not preclude the respondents from filing a suit for possession/ejectment at a subsequent stage, if there was a bona fide personal need.\n  5. The other issue raised by the appellants was that the shop in question belonged to all legal heirs of the original landlord, which included three brothers and there sisters. It was, therefore, argued that without impleading all the said legal heirs, the respondent No. 1 alone could not maintain the suit. The learned lower Courts found that the appellants had been paying rent to respondent No.1 which was evident from the rent payment receipts produced by the appellants themselves. Therefore, having accepted respondent No.1 as their landlord, they could not deny his right to file the suit. Even otherwise, one of the landlords can maintain a suit for ejectment of a tenant unless separate tenancy agreements are found to have been executed and the tenants have been paying rent to the landlord separately, which was not the case here. As such the said plea of the appellants was not accepted by the learned subordinate Courts.\n  6. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has contended that the learned subordinate Courts did not properly appreciate the effect of Exh.D.1 to Exh.D.8. These documents related to record of the case which had been filed by respondent No.1 against another tenant about five years ago and was settled by way of a compromise. The learned counsel submits that the said documents established that the suits against the petitioners had been filed to harass them and to pressurize them to increase the amount of rent payable by them.\n  7. I have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and perused the record with his assistance. The learned counsel has not been able to show anything from the record that the respondent No.1 had demanded enhancement of rent at any stage. Even otherwise the suit which was settled about five years ago cannot be used for all times to come in the future to defeat proceedings for eviction of a tenant on the ground of personal need. Each case has to be decided on its own merits. A tenant cannot be allowed to force a landlord to let him use the leased premises for an indefinite period notwithstanding landlord's personal need.\n  8. The other point argued by the learned counsel for the appellant is that there was nothing by way of evidence on record to establish bona fide personal need. As discussed above, respondent No.1 had categorically stated in his statement that he wanted to establish a show room for electronics by combining four shops, two of which he had already got vacated and he needed the other two shops to set up his business where his brother& could join him in running the show room of electronics. This evidence could not be disproved or shaken in cross-examination. The evidence as well as the other facts and circumstances relevant to the issue in question were taken into consideration by the learned lower Courts, who found the evidence believable and reliable enough to support the plea of the respondent No.1. It has been held by superior Courts that the solitary statement of the landlord is sufficient to establish bona fide personal need. The learned counsel for the appellant has not pointed out any evidence on record that may have led to a different conclusion.\n  9. I have examined the entire record and gone through the judgments and decrees of the learned lower Courts. Nothing has been pointed out in the decisions of the lower Courts which may be contrary to the law. Further the learned counsel has not pointed out any material issue which has not been determined or any substantial\" error or defect in the procedure adopted by the learned lower Courts that may possibly have led to a different result.\n  10. In view of the above, these appeals fail and same are accordingly dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.\n  M.U.Y./J-34/L Appeal dismissed.",

On behalf of the respondents, respondent No.1 appeared as a witness in support of the case and produced Ali Akbar as P.W.2. The petitioner appeared as a defence witness and produced five other witnesses including the post man to establish that there was no default and that the premises in question was not required by the landlord on account of personal need.",
      "case_judgement": "I have examined the entire record and gone through the judgments and decrees of the learned lower Courts. Nothing has been pointed out in the decisions of the lower Courts which may be contrary to the law. Further the learned counsel has not pointed out any material issue which has not been determined or any substantial\" error or defect in the procedure adopted by the learned lower Courts that may possibly have led to a different result.\n  10. In view of the above, these appeals fail and same are accordingly dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.\n  M.U.Y./J-34/L Appeal dismissed.",
      "case_proceddings": "The issue of default was not proved 'before the learned trial Court. It was not seriously contested in the appeal either. In support of the issue relating to personal need, respondent No.1 stated that two of his brothers were working in Lahore and Kuwait, and the family was running a business of electronics. They wished to set up a large show room for electronics by combining four shops. They had already got two shops vacated and needed the other two (subject matter of the present appeals) to complete the show room where the respondent's brothers could set up their electronics business on their return. Respondent No.1 was cross-examined. The petitioners could not bring anything on record to convince the learned subordinate Courts that the shops in question were not required by way of personal need. The only material placed on record was certain documents relating to suit filed in 2004 by respondent No.1 against some other tenant relating to some other shop, which had been withdrawn in terms of a compromise where under the tenant had agreed to increase the rent by 100%. On the basis of the said record it was argued that the suit against the appellants was also a device to enhance rent and that there was no bona fide personal need. The said evidence did not find favour with the learned lower Courts who held that the said fact did not preclude the respondents from filing a suit for possession/ejectment at a subsequent stage, if there was a bona fide personal need.\n  5. The other issue raised by the appellants was that the shop in question belonged to all legal heirs of the original landlord, which included three brothers and there sisters. It was, therefore, argued that without impleading all the said legal heirs, the respondent No. 1 alone could not maintain the suit. The learned lower Courts found that the appellants had been paying rent to respondent No.1 which was evident from the rent payment receipts produced by the appellants themselves. Therefore, having accepted respondent No.1 as their landlord, they could not deny his right to file the suit. Even otherwise, one of the landlords can maintain a suit for ejectment of a tenant unless separate tenancy agreements are found to have been executed and the tenants have been paying rent to the landlord separately, which was not the case here. As such the said plea of the appellants was not accepted by the learned subordinate Courts.\n  6. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has contended that the learned subordinate Courts did not properly appreciate the effect of Exh.D.1 to Exh.D.8. These documents related to record of the case which had been filed by respondent No.1 against another tenant about five years ago and was settled by way of a compromise. The learned counsel submits that the said documents established that the suits against the petitioners had been filed to harass them and to pressurize them to increase the amount of rent payable by them.\n  7. I have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and perused the record with his assistance. The learned counsel has not been able to show anything from the record that the respondent No.1 had demanded enhancement of rent at any stage. Even otherwise the suit which was settled about five years ago cannot be used for all times to come in the future to defeat proceedings for eviction of a tenant on the ground of personal need. Each case has to be decided on its own merits. A tenant cannot be allowed to force a landlord to let him use the leased premises for an indefinite period notwithstanding landlord's personal need.\n  8. The other point argued by the learned counsel for the appellant is that there was nothing by way of evidence on record to establish bona fide personal need. As discussed above, respondent No.1 had categorically stated in his statement that he wanted to establish a show room for electronics by combining four shops, two of which he had already got vacated and he needed the other two shops to set up his business where his brother& could join him in running the show room of electronics. This evidence could not be disproved or shaken in cross-examination. The evidence as well as the other facts and circumstances relevant to the issue in question were taken into consideration by the learned lower Courts, who found the evidence believable and reliable enough to support the plea of the respondent No.1. It has been held by superior Courts that the solitary statement of the landlord is sufficient to establish bona fide personal need. The learned counsel for the appellant has not pointed out any evidence on record that may have led to a different conclusion.\n  9. I have examined the entire record and gone through the judgments and decrees of the learned lower Courts. Nothing has been pointed out in the decisions of the lower Courts which may be contrary to the law. Further the learned counsel has not pointed out any material issue which has not been determined or any substantial\" error or defect in the procedure adopted by the learned lower Courts that may possibly have led to a different result.",

Brief facts giving rise to this petition are that the petitioners and the respondents were the irrigators from Outlet No.8780/L of Rajbah Jangal; the respondents preferred an application before respondent No.1 for conversion of their Nakka from 8780/L to 9220/L Rajbah Jangle Tehsil Dunyapur, District Lodhran. The said application was turned down by respondent No.1 i.e. DCO by virtue of his order dated 24-3-1996; being aggrieved thereof the respondents preferred an appeal before respondent No.2 SCO, who bifurcated the irrigable land into two Mogas i.e. Mogas No.8780/L and 9660/L with the direction to respondent No.1 to prepare the case/order and present for confirmation. The order by respondent No.1 was pronounced on 27-5-1997 and was approved by respondent No.2 on 12-8-1997. Petitioner assailed the order dated 27-5-1997 and the order dated 12-8-1997 passed by respondent No.1 and respondent No.2 in this writ petition.\n  3. Writ petition was admitted for regular hearing on 10-24998. Notices were issued to the respondents to file written statement, meanwhile, operation of the impugned order was suspended on 10-2-1998. Respondent Nos.3, 9 refused to accept the service while respondents Nos.10, 11, 12 were served by their family members (sons and brothers) but they were not turned up: They were proceeded ex parte on 23-12-2003.\n  4. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the order dated 27-5-1997 understands digging of new water course for Moga Burje 9660/L which was confirmed by respondent No.2 in its order dated 12-8-1997. The new water course cannot be raised without abridging one of the clauses of section 20 of the Canal and Drainage Act, 1873; that respondent while passing impugned orders have not complied or fulfilled the required conditions of section 20 of the Act, 1873; that impugned orders have been passed at the back of the petitioner, which is violation of principle of natural justice; that order dated 12-8-1997 is patently illegal and void as he has not applied his mind; that respondent No.2 had already rejected the application of the respondents Nos. 3 to 13 vide order dated 24-3-1996 (Annexure \"A\") in which he called the reasons after making enquiry, but he again passed the order dated 27-5-1997 just contrary to his previous order. This also proves the mala fide of the respondent No.1. By passing the order dated 27-5-1997 he cannot up set his own order dated 24-3-1996 because the appeal is provided under the law and it was only the respondent No.2 who could modify, reverse or confirm the order. Under the law, the respondent No.1 has no jurisdiction to change his own order. As a matter of fact the impugned order has been passed under political influence of the local MPA; that the order dated 27-5-1997 shows that respondent No.1 has passed this order in appeal against the order dated 24-6-1996 passed by the Sub-Divisional Canal Officer; under section 2 of the Canal and Drainage Act, 1873, no application can be given to the Sub-Divisional Canal Officer nor he is authorized to pass any order under Canal and Drainage Act, 1873; the original order under section 20 of the Canal and Drainage Act, 1873 can only be passed by respondent No.1 which is subject to the confirmation of the Superintending Canal Officer; in this view of the law, the impugned order shows that the original order was passed by the Sub-Divisional Canal Officer as such the whole proceedings are ab initio void; that firstly the enquiry was made by the Sub-Divisional Canal Officer which the learned respondent No.1 had taken into consideration and passed the order dated 24-3-1996 but while passing the impugned order, he has based the enquiry made by the Ziledar which cannot be given more weight than the Sub-Divisional Canal Officer.\n  5. Learned counsel for respondents Nos.4 and 5 has supported the impugned order passed by respondents Nos.1 and 2 contends that the impugned orders are legal, the same cannot be interfered in the present proceeding, order passed under section 20 of the Canal and Drainage Act (VIII of 1873) can only be assailed by filing a civil suit. Civil suit is efficacious remedy against the order passed under sections 20, 68 of Canal and Drainage Act (VIII of 1873), hence, this writ is liable to be dismissed. Reliance is placed on the case of Sultan Ahmad v. Superintending Engineer, Bahawalnagar 1988 MIL 1460 and Muhammad Idress and others v. Superintending Engineer and another 1996 CLC 1746.\n  6. Arguments heard. Record perused.\n  7. After hearing the arguments of the parties and going through the impugned order and record available on the file I am conscious of the fact that order passed under section 20 of the Canal and Drainage Act (VIII of 1878) primarily has to be challenged through a civil suit as disputed question of fact normally cannot be resolved through exercise of writ jurisdiction. The order, dated 27-5-1997 understands digging of new watercourse for Moga Burje 9660/L which was confirmed by respondent No.2 in its order dated 12-8-1997. The new water course cannot be raised without abridging one of the clauses of section 20 of the Canal Drainage Act, 1873 the said clauses read as under:---\n  \"The applicant shall not be entitled to use the link water course, if any, unit...\n  (a) he has paid to the land owner the compensation for the land occupied by such link water course in whatever shape if it is determined through mutual agreement, it has been rightly held in the case of Muhammad Mubeen v. DCO 2007 CLC 1168 that the canal authority should be applied for acquisition of land for establishment of the new water course.\n  (b) Possession of land for the said link water course has been acquired under the provisions of this Act.\n  The impugned order, therefore, is repulsive to the afore-stated law on the subject. Respondent No.2 SCO confirmed the order of the respondent No.1 by simply affixing a rubber stamp on the bottom of the order of respondent No.1 without applying the judicial independent mind. The stereotype rubber stamp has been pasted on the bottom of the impugned order of respondent No.1 after a lapse of more than two and half months in gross violation of law. The law fortified in section 20 at line 13 understands. After the expiry of thirty days of the announcement of the decision of the Divisional Canal Officer, if no objection is received and after giving due opportunity of hearing if an objection is received. 'The law enunciated in case of Bashir Ahmed v. Sardar Muhammad 1984 CLC 2158 understands as such a decision may be defined as determination arrived at after consideration of facts and in legal context law. The decision can be retarded the rejection of the application or its acceptance subject to the confirmation and modification by the Superintending Canal Officer. The application of mind for determination is not spelled out of a rubber stamp on the order which is to be confirmed. A birds eye over the mandatory requirement of law comprehend that the confirmation by the SCO respondent No.2 on order of respondent No.1 must be made within 30 days, the departure thereto renders the order to be sanctioned unenforceable in the eye' of law and a piece of paper only. It has been specifically enshrined that opportunity to parties be awarded before confirmation. In the instant case, no opportunity was afforded rendering the impugned order inoperative. No notice was pressed in services requiring the petitioner or the opposing party to appear and to put their cases before the SCO/respondent No.2 in case Muhammad Ismail v. Muhammad Sadiq and others 1971 SCMR 653 visualizes that 'principle found in old proverb \"audi altrem partem\" must be observed by Superintending Engineer. It is the time settled proposition of law that any order arrived at without associating the parties is a property of waste paper basket having no room in the domain of law. Any order passed in violation of principle of natural justice cannot have the legal effect. Mrs. Anisa v. PIAC and others 1994 SCMR 232 Order passed by respondent No.2 is merely affixing the rubber stamp on the orders dated 27-5-1997 passed by the respondent No.1/DCO, cannot be termed as legal determination of the appeal. The facts and circumstances of the present case demand that filing of civil suit may not be efficacious and speedy remedy. Controversy involved in the present writ petition can be resolved without entering into the disputed question of facts raised by the parties. Respondent No.2 acted in an unfair and arbitrary manner, hence, I am satisfied that without going to details of the factual controversy matter can be resolved in exercising the power under Article 199 of the Constitution. Reliance is placed on Messrs Wak Orient Power and Light Ltd. through Chief Secretary v. Government of Punjab, Ministry of Water and Power through Secretary 1998 CLC 1178, Messrs Pacific Multinational (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Inspector General of Police Sindh, Police Headquarter and 2 others PLD 1992 Kai. 283, Order passed by SCO-respondent No.2 is final in nature it can be assailed in a writ jurisdiction. Reliance is placed on Zulfiqar Ali and another v. Superintending Engineer, Multan and others PLD 1957 Lah. (W.P) 730. It is also significant to note that order dated 24-3-1996 and 27-5-1997 passed by respondent No.1 are at variance. In the first order respondent No.1-DCO concluded that contention of the present respondents are frivolous whereas in the second order he has accepted the contention without passing the detailed reasoning.\n  8. In view of the above facts and circumstances of the case, order dated 12-8-1997 passed by the respondent No.2/Superintending Canal Officer is declared illegal and same is set aside. Case is remanded back to respondent No.2 to pass afresh speaking order, after hearing the parties.\n  M.H./M-450/L????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

As per averments in the plaint, plaintiffs-petitioners claimed themselves to be the owners of the said property and that they were in possession of the same; that the defendants-respondents are neither owners of the said property, nor ever remained in its possession and that it was one year back that they without any entitlement entered into its possession and in spite of repeated demands are not prepared to leave the said land and hand it over to petitioners.\n  2. Defendants-respondents of appearance contested the suit through their written statement dated 26-9-1997 and amongst others stated that the suit property is not exclusively owned by plaintiffs-petitioners and was in fact \"Shamilat-e-Deh\" bearing Khasra No.538 measuring 212 Kanals 6 Marlas during the period 1929-1930 to 1951-1952, whereafter vide mutations Nos.285 to 288 this Khasra number was divided into two Khasra Numbers i.e. Khasra No.1861/538 measuring 43 Kanals, 13 Marlas and Khasra No.1862/538 measuring 168 Kanals 3, Marlas; that disputed Khasra No.1861/538 fell into the share of successors of one Ahmad Jee Khan but they never remained in its possession; that plaintiffs earlier instituted a Civil Suit No.134/1 titled Mst. Shah Pari and others v. Saadat Jan and others And in the light of judgment and decree dated 27-7-1962 in the said suit the earlier partition was cancelled; that on the basis of the said decree mutation No.711 of \"Ishtirak-I-Milkiyat\" was entered and attested, which resulted into the disputed property again going into common pool. Certain sales and purchases were also detailed in para.2 of the written statement but the same need not to be dilated upon.\n  3. In their rejoinder dated 13-10-1997 to the written statement, plaintiffs-petitioners took the stand that even if the defendants-respondents are admitted as co-owners in the disputed property, they are still entitled to possession of the same having been recorded in its possession since sufficient long time and that for the last few years defendants-respondents were tilling the said land as their tenants. This was a complete resile from the stand taken in the plaint.\n  4. Divergent pleadings resulted into framing of nine issues by trial Court on 21-10-1997. Issues Nos.7 and 8 being relevant for the present controversy are reproduced hereunder:: --\n  \"Issue No.7. Whether plaintiffs are joint owners of the land in dispute?\n  Issue No.8. Whether plaintiffs are entitled to decree for possession prayed for in the heading of the plaint?\n  5. On conclusion of the trial, the trial Court jointly took the afore-said issues for discussion and held that since the property is jointly owned by parties because the earlier partition was cancelled and property again put in common pool; that one co-sharer cannot seek possession of a specific portion in joint land except through regular partition on a suit under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act.\n  6. Resultantly, the suit was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 29-6-2005.\n  7. In appeal, Additional District Judge-VIII, Peshawar concurred with the trial Court and further held that the evidence produced does not conform with the plaint and that it has not been proved that the plaintiffs were dispossessed forcefully or by other means by the defendants-respondents. Accordingly, while dismissing the appeal, the judgment and decree of the trial Court were maintained.\n  8. Still aggrieved, plaintiffs-petitioners have filed the present revision petition.\n  9. I have heard Mr. Abdul Samad Khan Zaida, Advocate, learned counsel for petitioners and Malik Jarar Hussain, Advocate for respondents on pre-admission notice and gone through the record of the case.\n  10. While claiming exclusive title over the suit-land plaintiffs-petitioners had filed a simple suit for possession, which exclusive title was challenged by defendants-respondents. In spite of their exclusive title having been put to serious challenge in the written statement, plaintiffs-petitioners in, their rejoinder to the same did not attend to the issue seriously and instead changed their stand as against the one taken in the plaint and stated that defendants-respondents are their tenants and thus even if they are admitted to be co-sharers, still they are bound to surrender possession to them.\n  11. I am afraid, the contention of the plaintiffs-petitioners is without any force. In the plaint it had never been their case that respondents are tenants-at-will over the suit-land. The factum of cancellation of earlier mutation of partition and the property having again gone into common pool has been admitted by plaintiffs-petitioners in their evidence.\n  12. Though after the partition of Khasra No.538, the plaintiffs-petitioners are recorded as owners in possession of Khasra No.1861/538 measuring 43 Kanals, 13 Marlas and this entry continued till attestation of Mutation No.711 dated 26-11-1973 of \"Ishtirak-i-Milkiyat\" whereafter entries in the record of rights changed and land in dispute again went to common pool. How and when the plaintiffs-petitioners were dispossessed of the same and defendants-respondents entered into its possession is a mystery and alarming as well because it is against all norms of justice to deprive a co-sharer from possession of his lawful share through means other than lawful.\n  13. It is well settled and as held by Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as Samal Gul v. Central Government and others PLD 1986 SC 35 that a Court is empowered to grant such relief as the justice of the case may demand and for purposes of determining the relief asked for, the whole of the plaint must be looked into, so that the substance rather than the form should be examined. But in the instant case resort to Order VII, rule 7, C.P.C. cannot be made to help the plaintiffs-petitioners because of the suit being one for possession alone in respect of limited area and entire joint property not a subject matter of the suit, absence of other co,-owners besides.\n  14. In the circumstances, the only remedy available and left for petitioners is to go for partition of the joint holding, as held by Honourable Supreme Court in the judgment titled Mst. Resham Bibi and others v. Lal Din and others 1999 SCMR 2325.\n  15. Partition suit, if and when filed, the Court seized should do its best to decide the same in accordance with law on priority basis and within shortest possible time.\n  16.

Khalida Bibi, daughter of Noor Alam (deceased), by filing this revision petition under section 115, C.P.C. have called in question the judgment and decree dated 23-1-2009 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Kharian, District Gujrat, whereby he dismissed their appeal maintaining the judgment and decree dated 8-4-2008 passed by the learned Civil Judge IIIrd Class, Kharian, whereby he while closing their right of producing evidence under Order XVII rule 3, C.P.C. dismissed their suit for possession through pre-emption.\n  2. Precisely the facts giving rise to this revision petition are that a parcel of land measuring 7 Marlas, bearing Khasra Nos.735/2, Khata No.161/186, as per Register Haqdaran Zameen 2000-2001, situate at Mauza Kotla Qasim Khan, Tehsil Kharain was sold by Muhammad Afzal, Muhammad Amjad and Muhammad Inayat to Muhammad Sharif respondent for a consideration of Rs.7,000 but in the mutation it was mentioned as Rs.11,000, Noor Alam deceased, predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners, filed a suit for possession through pre-emption narrating therein that he came to know of the sale on 23-6-2004, at 9-00 a.m. through Muhammad Iqbal son of Muhammad Shafique in the presence of Haji Muhammad Siddique and Muhammad Aslam; he at once declared his intention of pre-emption in presence of the witnesses and thereby performed \"Talb-e-Mawathibat\", thereafter notice of \"Talb-e-Ishhad\" was served upon the respondent through registered Post/AD No.1462; dated 23-6-2004, attested by two truthful witnesses asking the respondent to admit superior right over the suit property and transfer the same, but he refused to do so; Noor Alam deceased filed a suit for possession through pre-emption on 31-7-2004 on the basis of common Khata and common source of water and having superior right over the suit property; the respondent contested the suit by filing written statement; out of the divergent pleadings of the parties, the learned trial Judge vide order dated 1-12-2004 proceeded to frame fourteen issues inclusive of the relief and fix 'the case for evidence of the plaintiff on 24-2-2005, on which date statement of Postmaster P.W. was recorded; thereafter on 26-5-2005, statement of one witness P.W.2 was also recorded and the case was postponed to 12-9-2005 for rest of the evidence of the plaintiff, but on the said date application for impleading legal heirs of Noor Alam plaintiff was filed, which was not contested by the respondent and was allowed; from 1-10-2005 to 30-11-2005, the case remained pending for filing of amended memo. of plaint and reply thereto; on the last date, the plaintiffs were ordered to produce evidence on 23-2-2006, but on the said date evidence was not produced; the petitioners moved an application seeking permission to produce secondary evidence, which was allowed on 28-7-2007 and the case was posted for hearing on 15-9-2007; thereafter seven adjournments were afforded to the petitioners for producing evidence and on 11-3-2008, the learned trial Judge providing last opportunity to the petitioners adjourned the case to 8-4-2008 and on the said date, when the petitioners again failed to produce their witnesses, their right to produce evidence was closed and their suit was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 8-4-2006; being aggrieved of the said judgment and decree, the petitioners/plaintiffs preferred appeal before the learned Additional District Judge, Kharian, which was also dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 23-1-2009. Hence, the instant revision petition.\n  3. This petition came up for hearing on 13-4-2009, when pre-admission notice was issued to the respondent for today. Service upon him was ordered to be effected through ordinary course, registered Post/AD as well as T.C.S. at the expense of the petitioners, but they failed to deposit the expenses, due to which notice could not be issued to the respondent. In this situation, I proceed to decide this revision petition today on merits.\n  4. It has been argued by the learned counsel for the petitioners that as the judgments and decrees of both the Courts below are result of misreading or non-reading of record, therefore, the same are not sustainable in the eyes of law; that due to unavoidable circumstances the petitioners could not produce the evidence as Muhammad Aslam (the petitioner), who is necessary witness, had gone abroad; that the judgments of the Courts below are contrary to law, perverse and, hence, are liable to be set aside.\n  5. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners at considerable length and have gone through the record available on the file as also judgments and decrees of the Courts below.\n  6. Perusal of the judgment and decree dated 8-4-2008 passed by the learned Civil Judge, Kharian reveals that the said learned Judge after observing the fact that the suit in hand had been filed on 31-7-2004 and issues had been framed on 1-12-2004 and from the said date, the suit was lingering on for the evidence of the petitioners for one reason or the other. Copy of order sheet of the trial Court appended with this petition shows that before death of Noor Alam, the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners, two witnesses had been examined and thereafter no witness was brought in the witness box despite acceptance of their application for production of additional evidence. Sufficient opportunities had been provided to the petitioners for the said purpose and ultimately the trial Court while granting them last opportunity on 11-3-2008 had postponed the case to 8-4-2008. Even on the said date, the learned counsel appearing on their behalf was directed to produce the evidence otherwise their right will .be struck off and the case was kept in waiting till 2-30 p.m. and at that juncture, the learned trial Judge proceeded to close the IA right of production of evidence of the petitioners.\n  7. Insofar as the appellate judgment and decree dated 23-1-2009 is concerned, it appears that the learned appellate Judge after viewing the case from all its angles and considering the grounds urged by the petitioners has rightly upheld the judgment and decree of the trial Court. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners that Muhammad Aslam, one of the petitioners, who was patient of sugar, eyesight and hypertension, had. undergone an operation at England and the doctor had advised him rest, due to which he could not come to Pakistan and ultimately he arrived in Pakistan on 18-4-2008, whereas his right to produce evidence was closed on 8-4-2008, does not carry any substance because this ground had not been taken by the learned counsel while filing the appeal before the Court below and on the day when the impugned judgment and decree was being passed, the learned counsel had produced Photostat of the Passport of Muhammad Aslam petitioner. The learned appellate Judge while dealing with the said stance, proceeded to observe that the said document goes on to show that the appellant is not interested in prosecution of the case instituted by him and that had he been interested, he must not have withheld the proceedings before the trial Court by not producing his evidence.\n  In the present case, issues had been framed on 1-12-2004 and statement of P.W.2 was recorded on 26-5-2005. The petitioners failed to produce their remaining evidence despite granting of more than nine consecutive and successive adjournments for the said purpose. They were also given warning, final and last opportunity at six different occasions. In this regard, conduct of the petitioners is clearly a misuse of the process of Court, for which no indulgence can be shown. Conduct of the petitioners indicates as to how much they were serious in their cause. The trial Court could not keep pending the cause for an indefinite period. It was duty of the plaintiff/petitioners to lead evidence in order to prove their cause.\n  Parties cannot claim adjournment as a matter of right. It is prerogative and discretion of the Court to grant or refuse adjournment in terms of Order XVII, rules 1 and 3, C.P.C. If sufficient cause is shown, the Court can grant adjournment in terms of provisions of sub-rule (2) of rule 1 of Order XVII C.P.C. It has been provided that when evidence of the case once begun, then hearing shall be continued from day-to-day until all the witnesses in attendance have been examined. Under sub-rule (3) of rule 1 of Order XVII, C.P.C., when sufficient cause is not shown, it has been provided that the Court shall proceed with the suit forthwith. These provisions are not meant to enable the party to cause improper delay in the proceedings. In the present case, petitioners had been provided as many as nine opportunities despite burden of costs and giving warning. The order sheet does not indicate \"sufficient reason\" for further adjournment, hence, the trial Court was right in proceeding under rule 3 of Order XVII, C.P.C. and dismissing the case on the basis of material available on the record. Reliance is placed on the cases of Zahoor v. Election Tribunal 2008 SCMR 322 and Muhammad Afzal v. Muhammad Ashraf 2004 YLR 1166.\n  8. The judgments and decrees passed by the Courts below are based on solid reasons. Sufficient opportunities had been provided to the petitioners to prove their claim, but they failed to do so and the matter remained pending for about more than three years for recording of evidence of the plaintiffs/petitioners. No misreading of record or misinterpretation of law has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioners in the impugned judgments and decrees.\n  9. Resultantly, this revision petition fails and is dismissed in limine.\n  S.A.K./M-370/L Revision dismissed.",

It is averred in the suit that the parties had entered into an agreement for sale of immovable property. The agreed, price was a sum of Rs.4.5 million. It was alleged by the respondent that he had paid earnest money in the sum of Rs.15,25,000 which fact is not denied by the appellant. It is also not denied that the respondent is in possession of the suit property although the position taken by the appellant is that such possession was not given pursuant to the agreement to sell. According to the petitioner respondent was in possession in his capacity as a tenant. The respondent also alleged that he has paid an additional sum of Rs.2.4 million subsequently, the petitioner denies receipt of any additional amount.\n  3.

I have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and gone through the documents attached with this appeal.

It appears that on 9-12-1981, an application for amendment in the decree was filed, which was accepted as a result of compromise between the parties on 21-9-1987. It was declared that Subedar Faqeer Muhammad Khan/decree-holder will be the owner of land number Khasra 131 min, measuring 3 Kanals and 9 Marlas 'along with the house and the decree dated 26-3-1978 stood cancelled to the extent of number Khasra 150. On 15-11-1990, an application for execution of the decree was filed in the Court of Senior Civil Judge, Poonch. Initially, a warrant was issued on 5-11-1992. This order was maintained on appeal by the learned District Judge, Poonch on 16-9-1993. On further appeal, vide judgment dated 27-4-1995; this Court remanded the case with the direction that the trial Court shall consider the original decree as well as the amended decree afresh and pass a fresh order. On remand, the case remained pending for one reason or the other, however, on 15-12-2005, the learned trial Court framed some questions in light of the direction of this Court as well as the report of the executing agency. Subsequently, vide order dated 29-12-2006, the learned Civil Judge issued a warrant for possession (Khas) against appellant, herein. Feeling aggrieved from the said warrant, the appellant challenged the legality and proprietary of the same before the learned District Judge, Poonch through appeal No.24 which was later on transferred to the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalakot. After hearing the parties, the learned Additional District Judge, dismissed the appeal vide his judgment dated 12-9-2008.\n  Sardar Ejaz Khan, the learned Advocate for the appellant, inter alia, contended that the judgment and order of the trial Court dated 29-12-2006 and that of the' first appellate Court date 12-9-2008 are illegal; erroneous and against the record, besides, being recorded in violation of the judgment of this Court, recorded in Civil Appeal No.55 titled Mst. Hafeeza Jan v. Subedar Faqeer Muhammad Khan, decided on 27-4-1995. The learned Advocate further contended that a compromise decree was obtained without hearing the appellant and the same cannot be executed against the appellant because she was not a party to it. The learned Advocate submitted that even otherwise, it was enjoined upon the trial Court to ascertain the true nature of the decree and the relief granted in view of the direction of this Court and this could only be done after recording the evidence. He argued that the decree was in-executable in view of the report of the revenue authorities. In support of his submissions, the learned Ad ocate placed reliance on the following cases:---\n  (1) 1991 CLC 424/436, (2) 1994 CLC 1530; (3) 2000 YLR 712.\n  Sardar Muhammad Suleman Khan, the learned Advocate for the respondents, controverted the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant and submitted that the appellant has challenged the warrant, firstly, through an appeal, which was dismissed by the learned District Judge, Poonch on 31-7-1988. No further appeal against this order was preferred, thus, the judgment of the learned District Judge has attained finality and the appellant cannot litigate further on the same subject in the presence of the afore-stated judgment. The learned Advocate contended that the appellant, again filed a suit on 16-10-1995, whereby, she challenged the amended judgment and decree dated 21-9-1987. After necessary proceedings, her suit was dismissed by the learned Sub.-Judge, Rawalakot on 30-5-1998 and her claim in respect of numbers Khasra 131 and 150 was rejected. The learned Advocate submitted that totally, a new case has been built up by the learned Advocate for the appellant and these objections have not been raised before the sub-ordinate Courts. He further submitted that the decree passed by the civil Court has to be executed and cannot be allowed to be frustrated on the report of any revenue authority., The learned Advocate relied upon the following cases:---\n  (1) 1992 SCMR 2175, (2) 1994 SCMR 22.\n  I have heard the learned Advocates for the parties and gone through the record of the case.\n  Record reveals that initially, a decree for joint possession was granted in favour of Subedar Faqeer Muhammad Khan, in respect of numbers Khasra 131 and 150 min measuring 3 Kanals along with a house, on 26-3-1978. It appears that on 9-12-1981 an application under section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure was made by Gulab Khan and Subedar Ali Akbar against the decree holder, Faqeer Muhammad Khan. As a result of a compromise, the decree was amended. Number Khasra 150 was deleted from the decree dated 26-3-1978. The amended decree was challenged by Mst. Hafeeza Jan before the learned District Judge and her appeal was dismissed on 31-7-1988. An application for execution of the decree was filed by the decree holder and warrant for possession was issued on 15-11-1992. This order was challenged before the learned District Judge, Poonch and the appeal was dismissed on 16-9-1993. This order was further challenged before this Court by way of appeal and the same was accepted on 27-4-1995. This Court directed the trial Court that after hearing the appellant, herein, a fresh order for execution of the decree may be issued. On remand, the learned Senior Civil Judge, Poonch has issued a warrant for (Khas) possession on 29-12-2006. Appeal against this order has also been dismissed through the impugned judgment. In my estimation, the learned trial Court has not complied with the remand order of this Court in letter and spirit, which is unfortunate.\n  Be that as it may, for the reasons to be recorded, hereinafter, I am of the view that this appeal has a substance and the orders passed by the learned trial Court as well as the first appellate Court need to be amended. In granting this relief, the judgment of the learned Civil Judge, Rawalakot dated 30-5-1998 and that of the learned District Judge dated B 31-7-1988 do not stand in the way of this Court because this Court has supervisory jurisdiction to correct the illegalities of the subordinate Courts. A perusal of the record would show that initially, a decree for joint possession was granted in favour of the predecessor in interest of the respondents, herein on 26-3-1978. Subsequently, an application was filed for correction of the decree under section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Though, number Khasra 150 has been deleted from the judgment dated 21-9-1987 but the fact of matter is that the nature of the decree remained unchanged and by no stretch of imagination it can be said that the trial Court while correcting the decree dated 26-3-1978 has passed a decree for (Khas) possession on 21-9-1987, which was beyond the scope of section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The decree for joint possession is to be executed in light of the provisions contained in Order XXI, rule 35 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n  Sub-rules (1) and (2) of rule 35 are reproduced as under:--\n  \"35. (1) Where a decree is for the delivery of any immovable property, possession, thereof shall be delivered to the party to whom it has been adjudged, or to such person as he may appoint to receive delivery on his behalf, and, if necessary, by removing any person bound by the decree who refuses to vacate the property.\n  (2) Where a decree is for the joint possession of immovable property, such possession shall be delivered by affixing a copy of the warrant in some conspicuous place on the property and proclaiming by beat of drum, or other customary mode, at some convenient place, the substance of the decree.\"\n  In view of the above provisions of law, only a warrant for delivery of joint possession should have been issued by the executing Court because law is well settled that the executing Court cannot go behind the decree. The judgment of the first appellate Court also needs to be amended, accordingly.\n  The appeal is, therefore, accepted. The warrant issued by the learned executing Court on 29-12-2006 shall be deemed to have been issued for joint possession of the suit-land and shall be executed by the respondents in accordance with the afore-mentioned provisions of law.\n  H.B.T./21/H.C.(AJ&K) Appeal accepted.",

It was declared that Subedar Faqeer Muhammad Khan/decree-holder will be the owner of land number Khasra 131 min, measuring 3 Kanals and 9 Marlas 'along with the house and the decree dated 26-3-1978 stood cancelled to the extent of number Khasra 150. On 15-11-1990, an application for execution of the decree was filed in the Court of Senior Civil Judge, Poonch. Initially, a warrant was issued on 5-11-1992. This order was maintained on appeal by the learned District Judge, Poonch on 16-9-1993. On further appeal, vide judgment dated 27-4-1995; this Court remanded the case with the direction that the trial Court shall consider the original decree as well as the amended decree afresh and pass a fresh order. On remand, the case remained pending for one reason or the other, however, on 15-12-2005, the learned trial Court framed some questions in light of the direction of this Court as well as the report of the executing agency. Subsequently, vide order dated 29-12-2006, the learned Civil Judge issued a warrant for possession (Khas) against appellant, herein. Feeling aggrieved from the said warrant, the appellant challenged the legality and proprietary of the same before the learned District Judge, Poonch through appeal No.24 which was later on transferred to the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalakot. After hearing the parties, the learned Additional District Judge, dismissed the appeal vide his judgment dated 12-9-2008.\n  ",
      "case_judgement": "  In view of the above provisions of law, only a warrant for delivery of joint possession should have been issued by the executing Court because law is well settled that the executing Court cannot go behind the decree. The judgment of the first appellate Court also needs to be amended, accordingly.\n  The appeal is, therefore, accepted. The warrant issued by the learned executing Court on 29-12-2006 shall be deemed to have been issued for joint possession of the suit-land and shall be executed by the respondents in accordance with the afore-mentioned provisions of law.\n  H.B.T./21/H.C.(AJ&K) Appeal accepted.",
      "case_proceddings": "Sardar Ejaz Khan, the learned Advocate for the appellant, inter alia, contended that the judgment and order of the trial Court dated 29-12-2006 and that of the' first appellate Court date 12-9-2008 are illegal; erroneous and against the record, besides, being recorded in violation of the judgment of this Court, recorded in Civil Appeal No.55 titled Mst. Hafeeza Jan v. Subedar Faqeer Muhammad Khan, decided on 27-4-1995. The learned Advocate further contended that a compromise decree was obtained without hearing the appellant and the same cannot be executed against the appellant because she was not a party to it. The learned Advocate submitted that even otherwise, it was enjoined upon the trial Court to ascertain the true nature of the decree and the relief granted in view of the direction of this Court and this could only be done after recording the evidence. He argued that the decree was in-executable in view of the report of the revenue authorities. In support of his submissions, the learned Ad ocate placed reliance on the following cases:---\n  (1) 1991 CLC 424/436, (2) 1994 CLC 1530; (3) 2000 YLR 712.\n  Sardar Muhammad Suleman Khan, the learned Advocate for the respondents, controverted the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant and submitted that the appellant has challenged the warrant, firstly, through an appeal, which was dismissed by the learned District Judge, Poonch on 31-7-1988. No further appeal against this order was preferred, thus, the judgment of the learned District Judge has attained finality and the appellant cannot litigate further on the same subject in the presence of the afore-stated judgment. The learned Advocate contended that the appellant, again filed a suit on 16-10-1995, whereby, she challenged the amended judgment and decree dated 21-9-1987. After necessary proceedings, her suit was dismissed by the learned Sub.-Judge, Rawalakot on 30-5-1998 and her claim in respect of numbers Khasra 131 and 150 was rejected. The learned Advocate submitted that totally, a new case has been built up by the learned Advocate for the appellant and these objections have not been raised before the sub-ordinate Courts. He further submitted that the decree passed by the civil Court has to be executed and cannot be allowed to be frustrated on the report of any revenue authority., The learned Advocate relied upon the following cases:---\n  (1) 1992 SCMR 2175, (2) 1994 SCMR 22.\n  I have heard the learned Advocates for the parties and gone through the record of the case.\n  Record reveals that initially, a decree for joint possession was granted in favour of Subedar Faqeer Muhammad Khan, in respect of numbers Khasra 131 and 150 min measuring 3 Kanals along with a house, on 26-3-1978. It appears that on 9-12-1981 an application under section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure was made by Gulab Khan and Subedar Ali Akbar against the decree holder, Faqeer Muhammad Khan. As a result of a compromise, the decree was amended. Number Khasra 150 was deleted from the decree dated 26-3-1978. The amended decree was challenged by Mst. Hafeeza Jan before the learned District Judge and her appeal was dismissed on 31-7-1988. An application for execution of the decree was filed by the decree holder and warrant for possession was issued on 15-11-1992. This order was challenged before the learned District Judge, Poonch and the appeal was dismissed on 16-9-1993. This order was further challenged before this Court by way of appeal and the same was accepted on 27-4-1995. This Court directed the trial Court that after hearing the appellant, herein, a fresh order for execution of the decree may be issued. On remand, the learned Senior Civil Judge, Poonch has issued a warrant for (Khas) possession on 29-12-2006. Appeal against this order has also been dismissed through the impugned judgment. In my estimation, the learned trial Court has not complied with the remand order of this Court in letter and spirit, which is unfortunate.\n  Be that as it may, for the reasons to be recorded, hereinafter, I am of the view that this appeal has a substance and the orders passed by the learned trial Court as well as the first appellate Court need to be amended. In granting this relief, the judgment of the learned Civil Judge, Rawalakot dated 30-5-1998 and that of the learned District Judge dated B 31-7-1988 do not stand in the way of this Court because this Court has supervisory jurisdiction to correct the illegalities of the subordinate Courts. A perusal of the record would show that initially, a decree for joint possession was granted in favour of the predecessor in interest of the respondents, herein on 26-3-1978. Subsequently, an application was filed for correction of the decree under section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Though, number Khasra 150 has been deleted from the judgment dated 21-9-1987 but the fact of matter is that the nature of the decree remained unchanged and by no stretch of imagination it can be said that the trial Court while correcting the decree dated 26-3-1978 has passed a decree for (Khas) possession on 21-9-1987, which was beyond the scope of section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The decree for joint possession is to be executed in light of the provisions contained in Order XXI, rule 35 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n  Sub-rules (1) and (2) of rule 35 are reproduced as under:--\n  \"35. (1) Where a decree is for the delivery of any immovable property, possession, thereof shall be delivered to the party to whom it has been adjudged, or to such person as he may appoint to receive delivery on his behalf, and, if necessary, by removing any person bound by the decree who refuses to vacate the property.\n  (2) Where a decree is for the joint possession of immovable property, such possession shall be delivered by affixing a copy of the warrant in some conspicuous place on the property and proclaiming by beat of drum, or other customary mode, at some convenient place, the substance of the decree.\"\n  In view of the above provisions of law, only a warrant for delivery of joint possession should have been issued by the executing Court because law is well settled that the executing Court cannot go behind the decree. The judgment of the first appellate Court also needs to be amended, accordingly.",

Kausar Parveen, was dismissed.\n  2. Briefly stated facts as those emerge out of this petition are that respondent No.2 wife of respondent No.3 Mumtaz Hussain Khan filed a suit for recovery of dower which was a house consisting of three rooms situated in Mauza Kotla Band Ali Tehsil Jatoi, District Muzaffargarh. On the strength of relevant column of Nikahnama and Registered Deed bearing No.1437 dated 9-10-1989. Since the said house was in possession of the petitioner and respondents Nos.3 to 5, therefore, possession of the same was also claimed. The said suit was filed in the family Court of Muzaffargarh which was contested by the petitioner by filing written statement wherein she took certain preliminary objections including lack of jurisdiction. Since the oral objection was also raised by the learned counsel for the defendant/petitioner that the suit was triable by the Civil Court and the Family Court lacked jurisdiction, with the prayer that the same may be decided before proceeding further, therefore, the learned Judge Family Court heard the arguments on the point of jurisdiction whereafter vide the impugned order dated 15-7-2005, the objection of the learned counsel for the present petitioner was rejected by holding that the Family Court had ample powers to adjudicate upon the suit which has been assailed through this Constitutional petition.\n  3. Vide order dated 21-10-2005 pre-admission notice was issued by this Court and in the meantime trial Court was directed not to pass any final order.\n  4. It is inter alia contended by Mr. Muhammad Ramzan Khalid Joyia, the learned counsel for the petitioner that the learned trial Court had assumed the jurisdiction not vested in it under the law; that in view of the very contents of the plaint itself there is an admission on the part of respondent No.2 that she had been paid Haq-ul-Mahar, therefore, suit before the learned Judge Family Court was not competent; that since there is a dispute of ownership, therefore, the learned Civil Court has the exclusive jurisdiction. That the jurisdiction assumed by the learned Judge Family Court is in utter disregard of provisions of section 5 of the Family Court Act. (XXXV of 1964); that the petitioner is the owner in possession of the house in question, therefore, cannot be deprived from her valuable property. Lastly contends that the suit filed by respondent No.2 was collusive with respondent No.3, therefore, should have been dismissed on this score alone; adds that in any case the controversy cannot be resolved without framing proper issue on the subject; places reliance upon 2000 MLD 1638.\n  5. Conversely Mr. Muhammad Mehmood Ashraf Khan, the learned counsel for the contesting respondent No.2 vehemently controverts the submissions made at' Bar by the learned ,counsel for the petitioner and with .vehemence argues that this was not at all a dispute which could be adjudicated upon by a Court of general civil jurisdiction and that the matter involved recovery of Haq-ul-Mahar, therefore, in view of provisions of section 5 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act (XXXV of 1964) exclusive jurisdiction vests in the learned Family Court, therefore, the suit filed by the respondent No.2 before the learned Judge Family Court is competent. Reliance is placed upon 1997 SCMR 1122 wherein the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in somewhat similar circumstances declined to interfere in the concurrent findings arrived at by the Courts below by observing that the Family Court in view of provisions of section 5 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act (XXXV of 1964) was empowered to entertain and decide such suits including the one for recovery of immovable property given as dower to the wife. The learned counsel for the respondent has also referred to some judgments of this Court wherein above principle of law laid down by the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan was respectfully followed.\n  6. Arguments heard. Record perused.\n  7. The controversy revolves around interpretation of section 5 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act (XXXV) of 1964 which is reproduced as under: --\n  Jurisdiction.--- (1) Subject to the provisions of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, and the Conciliation Courts Ordinance, entertain, hear and adjudicate upon matters specified in {Part 1 of the Schedule}.\n  (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1988 (Act V of 1898), the Family Court shall have jurisdiction to try the offences specified in Part-II of the Schedule, where one of the spouses is victim of an offence committed by the other.\n  (3) The High Court may with the approval of the Government, amend the Schedule so as to alter, delete or add any entry thereto.}\n  8. Judgment relied upon by Mr. Muhammad Khalid Joiya, Advocate for the petitioner Haji Muhammad Abbas v. Mrs. Naila Taranum Jamshed and 4 others 2001 PCr.LJ 628 has no relevance with the case in hand. Principle of law laid down here is in respect of powers of High Court under section 561-A, Cr. P. C., which are inherent, unbridled and wide enough so as to arrest and rectify any abuse, of process of Court and to make such orders a4 may be necessary to secure the ends of justice. Secondly in the referred case in view of peculiar circumstances matter was referred back to the authorities concerned for holding proper inquiry in the matter. I have not been able to understand as to how this case is relevant to one in hand.\n  9. The judgment referred to supra by Mr. Muhammad Mahmood Ashraf Khan, the learned. counsel for the respondent cited as 1997 SCMR 1122, which has also been relied upon by the learned lower Court, is fully attracted in view of peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and resolves the controversy, para. No.3 whereof is reproduced hereunder for favour of convenience:---\n  \"We have considered the submission made by the learned counsel for the parties carefully. We do not agree with the learned counsel for the petitioner. A plain reading of section 5 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 (W.P.

Learned counsel has failed to quote any provision of law restraining Judge Family Court to entertain suit for the recovery of immovable property given as dower to a wife. The three Courts below have believed the oral evidence as well as Kabinnama Exh.P.1 and Nikahnama Exh. P.3. Learned counsel has failed to point out any misreading or non-reading of evidence by the Courts below.

Resultantly the impugned order is upheld, with a direction to the learned respondent No.1 to proceed in the matter further in accordance with law.\n  12.

The appellants have assailed the same before this Court through the instant 1st appeal.\n  The facts of the case are as such, that the appellants acquired one Kanal land bearing Khasra No.7941/2109 owned by the respondent situated in Gilgit City and Award No.SO(R)-1/1942-44/94 dated 22-11-1994 was made by the Collector under the Act (hereinafter called Collector), whereby the Collector fixed Rs.172,570 per Kanal of the acquired land and offered the payment. The respondent received the compensation amount fixed by the Collector, but under protest and submitted application under section 18 of the Act before the Collector and the Collector referred the same to the referee Court/District Judge Gilgit. The Referee Court tried the application providing full opportunity to the parties to meet the issues framed by the Court.\n  At this juncture it is pertinent to note that the appellants neither submitted any documentary evidence along with the written replication submitted by them nor produced any witness in rebuttal or in proof of issues framed, they just relied on the statement of one Naib Tehsildar, recorded in the Court, contrary to the fact, the respondent submitted documentary evidence Exhs.P. 1 to P.10 and also adduced oral evidence in proof of issues. The learned referee Judge passed the impugned judgment after completion of the trial whereby he although discarded the claim of Rs.5,00,000 made by the respondent through the application under section 18 of the Act, but granted Rs.300,000 per Kanal of the acquired land along with 8% interest. The appellants impugned the judgment before this Court through the instant appeal but the respondent/petitioner neither filed any appeal nor cross objections made before this Court, which amounts acceptance of the rates fixed by the referee Court by him.\n  We heard the learned Assistant Advocate-General for the appellants and the learned counsel for the respondent and also have gone through the record of the case. The learned A.A.-G. urged (a) that the land acquired was agricultural in its nature and the Referee Court has wrongly declared the same to be situated in commercial area and (b) that the Collector had paid the prevailing rates after due inquiry as provided by relevant law as such he enhanced rates made by the Referee Court is contrary to the facts and the record and beyond his jurisdiction, he in support of his version cited the following case laws: (1) PLD 1986 SC page 158(2) 1998 MLD page 1592 Lah. (3) 1984 CLC page 459 (4) AIR 1974 SC page 2333.\n  In response, the learned counsel for the respondent argued that the land owned by the respondent acquired was and is located in commercial area in Gilgit city and the rates of acquired land fixed by the Collector were less than the rates prevailing at that time, this fact has been fully proved by the respondent before the Referee Court through documentary as well as oral evidence, while the appellants have failed to bring into record any documentary evidence or to produce any oral evidence before the Court hence, the Collector has fixed the rates of the acquired land arbitrarily and without resorting to the provisions of the Act, he referred the case-law in support of his contention as under: (1) PLD 1991 Lah. page 337 (2) PLD 1996 Pesh page 22 (3) PLD 1996 Lah. 171 (3) PLD 1997 Pesh.19.\n  In our opinion, the points, in the instant case require judicial determination are that (a) whether the acquired land situates in commercial area or situates in agricultural locality and (b) if the collector has acted in accordance with the Act and has inquired properly while fixing the market value of the land and (c) the learned referee Court has ignored the investigation made by the collector and has arbitrarily enhanced the rates. We before going to determine the above points would like to visit the Act generally to understand the procedure and the method which has been provided to the Collector to follow the same when he sits to acquire a land for Government purposes or otherwise under the Act.\n  Perusal of the Act transpires that, whenever, a Collector becomes functional to proceed for acquisition of land under the Act, he publishes preliminary notification under section 4 of the Act and proceeds further in accordance with the provisions of the Act, then he issues notice to the interested persons to inform them about the intention of the Government to take possession of the land and to provide a chance to submit their claims of compensation by attending personally or by agent before the Collector at any time fixed in the notice and on the day so fixed or on the adjourned date, the Collector makes enquiry as provided under section 11 of the Act and makes the award which becomes final under section 12. Section 15 of the Act directs the Collector to be guided by the provisions contained in sections 23 and 24 of the Act in determining of the amount of compensation of the acquired land and sections 23 and 24 of the Act have exhaustively provided the matters to be considered and neglected in determination of compensation.\n  In the instant case as has been noted by us in preceding para.3 of this judgment that the respondents have hopelessly failed to bring the record before the learned referee Court which might have transpired that the Collector had acted upon the above mentioned procedure and on the method prescribed by the Act and after being guided by the relevant provisions, he had made the award and fixed the compensation rates. Rather the representative of the respondents had admitted some facts which go in favour of the petitioners. While the respondent has placed documents Exh.P.1 to Exh.P.10 and also produced oral evidence before the Court, hence the petitioner/respondent has brought sufficient substance to prove that the aid situates in commercial area and the rate fixed by the Collector was less than that of the market value of the land acquired and the learned referee Court has rightly appreciated the same in the circumstances of the case.\n  We have gone through the case-law referred by the learned Assistant Advocate-General out of which only PLD 1986 SC page 158 is relevant in case in hand, whereby the august Supreme Court has prescribed the factors to be taken into consideration, while determining the value of the land to be acquired, the valuable observation and the salutary principle laid down by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan is reproduced as under:---\n  \"The land is not to be valued merely by reference to the use to which it is being put at the time at which its value has to be determined, but also by a reference to the uses to which it is reasonably capable of being put in future, and the market value is the potential value of the property at the time of acquisition which would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller, when both are actuated by business principles prevalent in the locality at that time.\"\n  \"This salutary principle is often ignored by the functionaries of the Government while assessing the amount of compensation to be awarded to the persons whose land is compulsorily acquired. The principle that the use to which the land is capable of being put, to the advantage of the owner, is a factor which ought to be considered by the assessing authority, has been enunciated in a number of cases.\"\n  \"While determining the value of the land acquired by the Government and the price which a willing purchaser would give to the willing seller, only the past sales should not be taken into account but the value of the land with all its potentialities may also be determining\".\n  We have been guided by the above observation and findings of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan that the future potentialities of the acquired. land is also a consideration but the Collectors often ignore this principle while, determining the rates of the acquired land, particularity in Gilgit, Baltistan, the Collectors do not bother to look into the provisions of the Act and also do not extend value to the guidelines framed by the higher judiciary in Pakistan. The behavior and the disinterest of the petitioners to bring any record into the file of the case show that the collector has not complied the provision of the Act, while the respondent stands in better legal position to prove his contention as such we are of the view that the learned Referee Court has not erred in the law by enhancing the rates fixed by the Collector, so we are prompted to decline the revision petition.\n  Consequent upon the above discussion, the appeal is dismissed and the impugned judgment/decree is maintained. No orders as to cost.\n  H.B. T./14/Glt. Appeal dismissed.",

Briefly the facts narrated in this petition are that the petitioner had applied for taking intermediate examination held in the year, 2004 against Roll No.34445 at D.G. Khan Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education. The petitioner having been found using unfair means was declared disqualified by the committee for further six examinations and an F.I.R. was also got registered against the petitioner. The above said Board informed the respondents Board about the conduct of the petitioner and recommended for cancellation of result card of Matriculation Examination of the petitioner, which he had passed in 1978 and the respondents after seeking legal advice have cancelled the result card of matriculation of petitioner.\n  3. Learned counsel for the petitioner intends that respondents could not cancel the result card of matriculation of the petitioner as the petitioner had already been punished by the D.G. Khan B.I.S.E. for the alleged fault on his part and the action of the respondents for cancellation of the result card is illegal and unlawful; that order has been passed by the respondents without affording opportunity of hearing to the petitioner which cannot be maintained in the eyes of law. Relies upon 2001 CLC 759.\n  4. Conversely learned counsel for the respondents contends that the judgment cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner has been overruled by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan through case reported in PLD 2004 SC 25; that under Chapter 5 Rule 14 of the Calendar of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Lahore the Board is empowered to cancel the result card of the petitioner; and that the petitioner was found to have used the unfair means in the examination, who does not deserve for any leniency and this petition may be dismissed.\n  5. I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties and the law cited by them.\n  6. It is not denied that the petitioner had passed his Matriculation Examination in the year, 1978. Subsequently the petitioner appeared in the Intermediate Examination from D.G. Khan B.I.S.E. held in the year, 2004 and was allotted Roll No.34445, who was found having used unfair means for which he has already been punished by restraining him from appearing in the examination of Intermediate for six times, but the B.I.S.E. on the receipt of information that the petitioner had used unfair means in Intermediate Examination in the year, 2004 has cancelled the matriculation certificate of the petitioner, which he had cleared in the year, 1978. Learned counsel for the respondent has relied upon Chapter 5 Rule 14 of the Calendar of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Lahore, which is re-produced here as under:---\n  \"The Board shall have the power to quash the result of a candidate at any time after it has been declared:\n  (1) if he has been disqualified for using unfair means in the examination; or (2) if a mistake is found in his result; or (3) if it is found that he was not eligible to appear in the examination; or (4) for any other reason that may be determined by the Board.\"\n  From the bare perusal of the above rule it is clear that clauses (1) to (3) relates to the same examination on having found the same the Board is empowered to quash the result of a candidate, which is not case of the petitioner and only clause (4) has to be interpreted.\n  7. It is not denied that petitioner did not use unfair means in the Matriculation Examination and he was eligible to appear in the examination in the year, 1978 when he cleared the same and it became a past and closed chapter. No document has been shown that the Board had already declared that any candidates subsequently found to have been used unfair means even after a period of 30 years in any examination would be liable for cancellation of his earlier academic certificates as well. Nothing has been brought to the notice of the Board that the petitioner had obtained the matriculation certificate by using unfair means as well. Hence, the order for cancellation of matriculation certificate of the petitioner is not sustainable. Although the case-law cited by learned counsel for the petitioner has been overruled by august Supreme Court of Pakistan in PLD 2004 SC 25, but however this case does not support the case of the respondents and relevant portion is reproduced here as under:---\n  \"From a perusal of the above noticed rules governing the `Parts System' of the Intermediate Examination, the scheme which emerges is that the two parts of Intermediate Examination are not two independent examinations and were in fact the parts, as the nomenclature itself indicates, of the same Intermediate Examination which was to be held with a gap of 12 months as compared to the earlier scheme in which the examination of the different papers of different subjects was held with a gap only of days. Therefore, we find that the view expressed by the learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court that Part-1 Examination of the Intermediate Examination was an independent entity was not correct and consequently it could not be said that the said part of the Examination in question, once taken, could be treated as a past and a closed transaction for all the purposes.\n  In the cited case it has been held that the examination conducted in parts is not independent to each other and the fault committed by the candidate in any part of the examination would affect the whole examination. Consequently it could not be said that the result of the First Part of the Examination having once been declared had become a past and a closed transaction, which could not be cancelled on account of a candidate having found using unfair means in any of the papers of the Second Part of the same examination. However, here the position is different. The examination of matriculation had no nexus with the Intermediate Examination and both being different entities, the petitioner could not be penalized by cancellation of his matriculation certificate as well in which there was no sort of allegation against the petitioner.\n  10. For the foregoing discussion, the impugned order for cancellation of the matriculation certificate of the petitioner cannot be sustained, which is set aside and this writ petition stands accepted in the same terms.\n  H.B.T./M-590/L Petition accepted.",

Learned counsel for the respondent has relied upon Chapter 5 Rule 14 of the Calendar of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Lahore, which is re-produced here as under:---\n  \"The Board shall have the power to quash the result of a candidate at any time after it has been declared:\n  (1) if he has been disqualified for using unfair means in the examination; or (2) if a mistake is found in his result; or (3) if it is found that he was not eligible to appear in the examination; or (4) for any other reason that may be determined by the Board.\"\n  From the bare perusal of the above rule it is clear that clauses (1) to (3) relates to the same examination on having found the same the Board is empowered to quash the result of a candidate, which is not case of the petitioner and only clause (4) has to be interpreted.\n  7. It is not denied that petitioner did not use unfair means in the Matriculation Examination and he was eligible to appear in the examination in the year, 1978 when he cleared the same and it became a past and closed chapter. No document has been shown that the Board had already declared that any candidates subsequently found to have been used unfair means even after a period of 30 years in any examination would be liable for cancellation of his earlier academic certificates as well. Nothing has been brought to the notice of the Board that the petitioner had obtained the matriculation certificate by using unfair means as well. Hence, the order for cancellation of matriculation certificate of the petitioner is not sustainable. Although the case-law cited by learned counsel for the petitioner has been overruled by august Supreme Court of Pakistan in PLD 2004 SC 25, but however this case does not support the case of the respondents and relevant portion is reproduced here as under:---\n  \"From a perusal of the above noticed rules governing the `Parts System' of the Intermediate Examination, the scheme which emerges is that the two parts of Intermediate Examination are not two independent examinations and were in fact the parts, as the nomenclature itself indicates, of the same Intermediate Examination which was to be held with a gap of 12 months as compared to the earlier scheme in which the examination of the different papers of different subjects was held with a gap only of days. Therefore, we find that the view expressed by the learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court that Part-1 Examination of the Intermediate Examination was an independent entity was not correct and consequently it could not be said that the said part of the Examination in question, once taken, could be treated as a past and a closed transaction for all the purposes.\n  In the cited case it has been held that the examination conducted in parts is not independent to each other and the fault committed by the candidate in any part of the examination would affect the whole examination. Consequently it could not be said that the result of the First Part of the Examination having once been declared had become a past and a closed transaction, which could not be cancelled on account of a candidate having found using unfair means in any of the papers of the Second Part of the same examination. However, here the position is different. The examination of matriculation had no nexus with the Intermediate Examination and both being different entities, the petitioner could not be penalized by cancellation of his matriculation certificate as well in which there was no sort of allegation against the petitioner.",

E. C. H. S. , Karachi and the petitioners are tenants of these two shops. Both the petitioners pay for the respective shops monthly rent at the rate of Rs.1,613 that was fixed under the tenancy agreement executed by the petitioners on 23-7-1995 with the previous owner of the shops. After purchasing the shops in question the respondent No.1 in the year, 2006 filed rent cases against the petitioners under section 8 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 seeking determination of fair rent. Enhancement was sought to the extent of Rs.2,70,000 per month. In other words, enhancement was sought upto Rs.1,136 per square feet.\n  The petitioners contested the proceedings and claimed that as the premises were obtained by them on rent on payment of huge Pugri, the enhancement in rent is not justified. They also claimed that not only petitioners paid huge Pugri but the respondent No.1 became owner on payment of meagre amount of Rs.19,00,000, therefore; the respondent No.1 is not entitled for enhancement in the rent for such reason as well. To justify enhancement of rent, respondent No.1 on his part has also produced in evidence three rent agreements of the neighbouring areas. In the first agreement the shop having an area of 318 square feet was rented out in the year, 2005 at Rs.60,000 per month and the rate of rent per square feet comes to Rs.188. In the second rent agreement the premises having an area of. 1400 square feet was rented, out at Rs.1,75,000 per month the rate of which comes to Rs.125 per square feet. In the third rent agreement an area of 2100 square feet with mezzanine area of 1300 square feet was rented out at Rs.95,000 per month and its rate of rent comes to Rs.45 per square feet. The Rent Controller enhanced the rent to Rs.50,000 per month for each shop. The petitioners then filed appeal and while dismissing the appeal, the Additional District Judge further enhanced the rent of each shop from Rs.50,000 to Rs.1,00,000. The petitioners being aggrieved have filed these petitions.\n  The payment of Pugri to the landlord or the value on which the landlord becomes owner of a premises is no consideration in law for determining the fair rent under section 8 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979. This section is very clear. It narrates the factors which are only to be considered while fixing fair rent. Acknowledging this legal position, learned counsel for the petitioners very candidly conceded that the Rent Controller while deciding application under section 8 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 does not have to take into consideration the question whether the premises was obtained by the tenant on Pugri or whether the landlord became its owner after purchasing the same at a price which is much less than the market value. He, however, vehemently opposed the exorbitant increase in rent from Rs.1,600 to Rs.1,00,000 per month. He submitted that the Rent Controller had increased the rent of each shop to Rs.50,000 which was further enhanced in appeal to Rs.1,00,000 per month though no appeal was filed by the respondent No.1 nor any cross-objections submitted. He next contended that even if the three rent agreements that were produced with regard to tenancies of the locality, the rate of rent of the third agreement comes to Rs.45 per square feet and at best the rent should have been increased to the extent of Rs.45 per square feet and no more.\n  In reply learned counsel for the respondent No.1 while defending the increase made by the Additional District Judge relied upon the case reported in PLD 1994 SC 725 and stated that even where no appeal is preferred or cross-objections filed, relief can be granted by the appellate Court. He, however, failed to show from any part of the evidence the justification for fixing the rent to the extent of Rs.1,00,000 per month for each shop. He also stated that in the agreements that were produced in evidence the maximum rate of rent of the nearest premises, having an area of 318 square feet is Rs.188 per square feet.\n  Learned counsel for the petitioners has contended that neither the original agreements were produced nor its attesting witnesses were examined and therefore no reliance could be placed on such agreements. This agreement is misconceived. The authenticity of these documents was not challenged before the Rent Controller. , Even otherwise these are one of those documents which cannot be obtained in original. If a tenant doubts their authenticity, an order could be obtained from Court to get it verified from the parties of such documents.\n  When these three rent agreements that were produced in evidence are examined the position which emerges is as follows:---\n  (1) The premises having an area of 318 square feet, the rate of rent is Rs.188 per square feet.\n  (2) The premises having an area of 400 square feet, the rate of rent is Rs.145 per square feet.\n  (3) The premises having an area of 2100 square feet, the rate of rent is Rs.45 per square feet.\n  Upon examination the three agreements and generally what is prevailing in the commercial market is that where the area of the premises is smaller, per square feet rate is always higher. Apart from this reasoning in the difference of rate per square feet in the above-referred three rent agreements, the nearest shop to the premises in question is only 300 meter away which fetches rent @ Rs.188 per square feet. Furthermore, the shops in question are also on the corner of Tariq Road Crossing which is prime area of Tariq Road. The area of each of the shops in question is only 238 square feet and the area of the nearest shop for which the rent is payable @ of Rs.188 per square feet is 318 square feet, hence, taking into consideration the area of the said shop and the shops in question the rate of rent of the shops in question should be fixed slightly more than the nearest shop which pay rent @ of Rs.188 per square feet. Keeping in view that the shops in question are situated in the prime area of Tariq Road and located on ground floor of the building and comparing its area with the area of Shop No.G-5 rent. which fetches rent @ Rs.188 per square feet, the rent should have been enhanced to Rs.200 per square feet. The Additional District Judge enhanced the rate of rent to Rs.1,00,000 per shop without taking into consideration the evidence that has come on record, thus, the fixation of rent at the rate of Rs.1,00,000 per shop was not justified. I consider Rs.200 per square feet to be reasonable rent. The enhanced rent @ Rs.200 per square feet shall be effective from 24-5-2006 which is the date of the filing of the rent case. As more than three years have already elapsed, the landlord has also become entitled to the benefit under section 9 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979. Section 9 entitles a landlord to get an enhancement in rent after three years to the extent of 10% per annum. Therefore, the rent after the expiry of three years from its fixation under section 8 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance i.e. from 24-5-2006 when the rent case was filed shall be enhanced @ 10% per annum or 30% after an interval of 3 years. The rent therefore, from 24-5-2009 onwards shall stand increased to Rs.260 per square feet.\n  These petitions were disposed of by the following short order dated 13-8-2009 and these are the reasons for the same:---\n  \"For reasons to be recorded later on, the impugned judgment is modified to the extent that the fair rent stands fixed at the rate of Rs.200 per square feet payable from 24-5-2006 and shall further be enhanced at the rate provided in section 9 Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 w.e.f. 24-5-2009. Both the parties shall file statement of Account in terms of this order before the Nazir of this Court, who shall then release the differential amount to the respondent accordingly.\n  S.A.K./A-143/K Order accordingly.",

Briefly stated facts as those emerge out of, this petition are that the respondent No.1 Haji Shameem Uddin filed a suit under Order XXXVII, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. for the recovery of Rs.20,00,000 (twenty lac) against respondent No.2 Abdul Qadeer son of Muhammad Yousif (real brother of the petitioner), which was decreed in favour of respondent No.1/plaintiff and against respondent No.1/defendant vide judgment and decree dated 4-5-2006. The execution petition for the satisfaction of above noted decree dated 4-5-2006, was filed before the learned Executing Court, who vide order dated 23-6-2006 directed attachment of movable and immovable property of judgment-debtor/ respondent No.2, in compliance whereof bailiff of the Court attached certain articles details whereof is available on the record. The petitioner filed an objection petition before the learned Executing Court on the grounds that certain articles attached for satisfaction of the decree, did not belong to the judgment-debtor rather were property of the petitioner, therefore, under the law could not be attached, which was contested by the decree-holder and finally vide the impugned order dated 24-11-2006, the learned Additional District Judge Lodhran/Executing Court dismissed the said petition which order is being assailed through this petition.\n  3. This petition is at motion stage. It is inter alia contended that the articles attached in satisfaction of the decree were not the property of the judgment-debtor his real. brother and that those have illegally been attached by the bailiff and that the learned trial Court proceeded to pass the impugned order without holding any proper inquiry.\n  4. The learned counsel for the petitioner in support of his contentions has relied upon Mst. Surriya Begum v. Muslim Commercial Bank Limited and 4 others PLD 1940 Lah. 4, Shaukat Ali and others v: Bank Tribunal for Karachi and Sakhar and others 2001 MLD 1828, Muhammad Rafi and others v. Muhammad Shafique, Civil Judge Hasilpur and others 1993 CLC 1903. To canvass that before rejection of objection petition, appropriate inquiry has to be held.\n  5. Arguments heard. Record perused.\n  6. The perusal of impugned order reveals that the learned Executing Court has non-suited the petitioner on the following grounds:--\n  (i) No proof of ownership of the petitioner qua articles attached in execution has been placed on record.\n  (ii) The articles were attached in the presence of Abdul Ghaffar petitioner and no objection of whatsoever nature was raised by him.\n  (iii) The possibility of collusiveness of filing the objection petition with the judgment-debtor cannot be ruled out.\n  7. The petitioner in support of his claim has appended with this petition three alleged original receipts allegedly issued by Batala Zari Showroom, signed by one Rafaqat. These alleged receipts also falsify the claim of the petitioner for following reasons:---\n  (a) One receipt dated 8-10-2003 stated to have been issued in the name of petitioner Abdul Ghaffar is regarding purchase of two articles worth Rs.30,000 only and finds cutting on the year of issuance thereof. It seems that date of this receipt has been changed.\n  (b) Two other receipts on the face of it appears to be afterthought and even prepared after the rejection of objection petition. I, therefore, find weight in the observations of the learned Executing Court, to the effect that no solid proof has been placed on record, for the simple reason that had the petitioner been in possession of these receipts, he could very comfortably place on the record of the learned Executing Court and after obtaining certified copy therefrom could append the same with this petition. I also find myself in agreement with the learned lower Court that possibility of filing ejectment petition in connivance with the judgment-debtor cannot be ruled out.\n  8. Now adverting to the judgments referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioner PLD 1970 Lah. 2004. In this case the objector had placed on record registered sale-deed in support of his claim that he was bona fide purchaser with consideration of the attached property and that without framing any issues, the objection petition filed by him was dismissed whereupon this Court directed the learned Executing Court, by observing that sufficient prima facie proof was available on record, therefore, decide the objection petition after framing issue and by giving fair opportunity to the parties to lead evidence in support of their respective claim 2001 MLD 1828, in this case too the objector based his claim on the strength of a sale-deed duly registered with the Sub Registrar and it was directed that in view of such prima facie proof the objection petition has to be decided after proper investigation. In the third referred case by the learned counsel for the petitioner 1993 CLC 1903 Muhammad Rafi v. Civil Judge, Hasilpur, the petitioner had approached this Court directly without filing any objection petition before the learned Executing Court whereupon this Court held that an. adequate and efficacious remedy of filing of objection petition before the learned Executing Court was available to that petitioner, therefore, Constitutional petition was not competent. The case-law cited at Bar by the learned counsel for the petitioner is-of no help to him. For the simple reason that in the above noted cases registered sale-deed in support of claim of ownership of the objector was produced before the learned trial Court and this Court rightly held that in presence of such a prima facie proof the objection petition could not be dismissed summarily without giving any opportunity to the objector to produce evidence in support of his contention.

      "case_facts": "Briefly stated facts as those emerge out of, this petition are that the respondent No.1 Haji Shameem Uddin filed a suit under Order XXXVII, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. for the recovery of Rs.20,00,000 (twenty lac) against respondent No.2 Abdul Qadeer son of Muhammad Yousif (real brother of the petitioner), which was decreed in favour of respondent No.1/plaintiff and against respondent No.1/defendant vide judgment and decree dated 4-5-2006. The execution petition for the satisfaction of above noted decree dated 4-5-2006, was filed before the learned Executing Court, who vide order dated 23-6-2006 directed attachment of movable and immovable property of judgment-debtor/ respondent No.2, in compliance whereof bailiff of the Court attached certain articles details whereof is available on the record. The petitioner filed an objection petition before the learned Executing Court on the grounds that certain articles attached for satisfaction of the decree, did not belong to the judgment-debtor rather were property of the petitioner, therefore, under the law could not be attached, which was contested by the decree-holder and finally vide the impugned order dated 24-11-2006, the learned Additional District Judge Lodhran/Executing Court dismissed the said petition which order is being assailed through this petition.",
      "case_judgement": "It may be observed hereunder the law in every case the learned Executing Court is not bound to hold regular inquiry by framing issues and providing opportunities to the parties to produce evidence rather Court is vested with the power to reject objection petition summarily in absence of prima facie proof and also where the collusiveness is found.

In the case in hand the learned Executing Court rightly found collusiveness of the petitioner with judgment-debtor, which is even floating on the surface of the record. I find the impugned order as perfectly legal thus the same is maintained. I, therefore, while upholding the impugned order and finding no merits in this petition proceed to dismiss the same in limine accordingly.\n  M.H./ A-128/L Petition dismissed.",
      "case_proceddings": " This petition is at motion stage. It is inter alia contended that the articles attached in satisfaction of the decree were not the property of the judgment-debtor his real. brother and that those have illegally been attached by the bailiff and that the learned trial Court proceeded to pass the impugned order without holding any proper inquiry.\n  4. The learned counsel for the petitioner in support of his contentions has relied upon Mst. Surriya Begum v. Muslim Commercial Bank Limited and 4 others PLD 1940 Lah. 4, Shaukat Ali and others v: Bank Tribunal for Karachi and Sakhar and others 2001 MLD 1828, Muhammad Rafi and others v. Muhammad Shafique, Civil Judge Hasilpur and others 1993 CLC 1903. To canvass that before rejection of objection petition, appropriate inquiry has to be held.\n  5. Arguments heard. Record perused.\n  6. The perusal of impugned order reveals that the learned Executing Court has non-suited the petitioner on the following grounds:--\n  (i) No proof of ownership of the petitioner qua articles attached in execution has been placed on record.\n  (ii) The articles were attached in the presence of Abdul Ghaffar petitioner and no objection of whatsoever nature was raised by him.\n  (iii) The possibility of collusiveness of filing the objection petition with the judgment-debtor cannot be ruled out.\n  7. The petitioner in support of his claim has appended with this petition three alleged original receipts allegedly issued by Batala Zari Showroom, signed by one Rafaqat. These alleged receipts also falsify the claim of the petitioner for following reasons:---\n  (a) One receipt dated 8-10-2003 stated to have been issued in the name of petitioner Abdul Ghaffar is regarding purchase of two articles worth Rs.30,000 only and finds cutting on the year of issuance thereof. It seems that date of this receipt has been changed.\n  (b) Two other receipts on the face of it appears to be afterthought and even prepared after the rejection of objection petition. I, therefore, find weight in the observations of the learned Executing Court, to the effect that no solid proof has been placed on record, for the simple reason that had the petitioner been in possession of these receipts, he could very comfortably place on the record of the learned Executing Court and after obtaining certified copy therefrom could append the same with this petition. I also find myself in agreement with the learned lower Court that possibility of filing ejectment petition in connivance with the judgment-debtor cannot be ruled out.\n  8. Now adverting to the judgments referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioner PLD 1970 Lah. 2004. In this case the objector had placed on record registered sale-deed in support of his claim that he was bona fide purchaser with consideration of the attached property and that without framing any issues, the objection petition filed by him was dismissed whereupon this Court directed the learned Executing Court, by observing that sufficient prima facie proof was available on record, therefore, decide the objection petition after framing issue and by giving fair opportunity to the parties to lead evidence in support of their respective claim 2001 MLD 1828, in this case too the objector based his claim on the strength of a sale-deed duly registered with the Sub Registrar and it was directed that in view of such prima facie proof the objection petition has to be decided after proper investigation. In the third referred case by the learned counsel for the petitioner 1993 CLC 1903 Muhammad Rafi v. Civil Judge, Hasilpur, the petitioner had approached this Court directly without filing any objection petition before the learned Executing Court whereupon this Court held that an. adequate and efficacious remedy of filing of objection petition before the learned Executing Court was available to that petitioner, therefore, Constitutional petition was not competent. The case-law cited at Bar by the learned counsel for the petitioner is-of no help to him. For the simple reason that in the above noted cases registered sale-deed in support of claim of ownership of the objector was produced before the learned trial Court and this Court rightly held that in presence of such a prima facie proof the objection petition could not be dismissed summarily without giving any opportunity to the objector to produce evidence in support of his contention. The facts and circumstances of the present case are altogether different and the judgments cited at Bar are not applicable in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case. On the contrary in case in hand no prima facie proof of ownership was even placed on record of the learned Executing Court, which is evident from the fact that the original so-called receipts have been placed on the record for the first time before this Court, genuineness whereof on the face of these receipts is doubtful. I find, no illegality or misreading/non-reading of the record, attributable to the learned Executing Court in passing the impugned order.",

Irum Mahal defendant-respondent No.1 (vendee) along with her written statement filed an application for rejection of the plaint on the twin grounds of non-deposit of 1/3rd of Rs.4,06,000, the, price entered in the sale mutation and limitation.\n  2. The application filed on 22-3-2005 was duly contested by Muhammad Ghaffar plaintiff-petitioner and ultimately dismissed by trial Court vide order dated 25-1-2006 holding that determination of sale consideration entered in the sale mutation is subject to proof and similarly question of limitation was held to be a mixed question of law and facts, thus requiring evidence.\n  3. The order of the trial Court passed on 25-1-2006 was assailed by defendant-respondent No.1 before District Judge/Zilla Qazi, Swat through Civil Revision No.48/C.R. of 2006, which came up for hearing on 30-11-2006 before Additional District/Izafi Zilla Qazi-III, Swat and while allowing the same order impugned was set aside and suit of the plaintiff-petitioner dismissed on both the grounds urged in the application of defendant-respondent No.1, hence the present writ petition challenging the revisional order dated 30-11-2006.\n  4. We have heard Mr. Muhammad Taif Khan, Advocate for the petitioner and Mr. Afridi Khan, Advocate assisted by Aziz-ur-Rehman, Advocate for the contesting respondent No.1.\n  5. It was argued by learned counsel for petitioner that petitioner had in his plaint categorically stated that in spite of his best efforts he could not lay his hands upon the sale-deed and had stated the sale consideration as Rs.2,00,000 in good faith; that pursuant to Court order dated 3-1-2005 for deposit of 1/3rd of the sale consideration as. required under section 24, N.-W.F.P. Pre-emption Act, 1987 plaintiff-petitioner deposited an amount of Rs.70,000 i.e. in excess of 1/3rd of Rs.2,00,000, that the question of limitation is a mixed question of law and facts, which can be answered only after recording of evidence, more particularly when the mutation introduced in defence by defendant-respondent was subject of review and was in fact reviewed on 25-11-2004 after sanction for review was accorded by Collector; that from the date of review the suit on its face is 'within time; that it has yet to be proved through evidence that the mutation pertains to the suit-land or some other land. He accordingly argued that in view of the above it was not a fit case for exercise of revisional jurisdiction by Additional District Judge and that on acceptance of the writ petition, the same be declared to be without lawful authority and thus ineffective upon the rights of plaintiff-petitioner. He placed reliance on cases reported as 2004 SCMR 535 and PLD 2004 Pesh. 1259 to substantiate his submissions.\n  6. As against that, learned counsel for defendant-respondent No.1 argued that plaintiff-petitioner No.1 was in the know of sale mutation but had purposely and with mala fide intention mentioned an incorrect amount as sale consideration in order to avoid 1/3rd of the actual amount; that limitation has to be reckoned from the date of attestation of mutation as provided under section 31, Act ibid and thus the suit on its face was barred by time. Accordingly, order passed in revision was argued to be in accordance with law and did not call for interference in our constitutional jurisdiction.\n  Learned counsel placed reliance on case-law reported as 2004 SCMR 1941, 2001 SCMR 543, 2004 CLC 2004 and PLD 2003 Pesh. 189.\n  7. We have considered the respective contentions on either side and gone through the record of the case.\n  8. Section 24, N.-W.F.P Pre-emption Act, 1987 makes it obligatory for the Court to direct the plaintiff-respondent to deposit in such Court 1/3rd of the sale consideration and if no sale price is mentioned in the sale-deed, then to order deposit 1/3rd of the probable value of the property.\n  9. In the instant case in view of the averments in the plaint, when the defendant-respondent introduced sale consideration of Rs.4,06,000 as against the one alleged by plaintiff-petitioner, the proper, appropriate and legal course for the trial Court was to have directed the plaintiff-pre?emptor to make up the deficiency in the said amount by a specified date. My this view is supported by the law settled by august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases titled as Haji Gul Nabi v. Mst. Sahib Jamala 1994 SCMR 845, Muhammad Din v. Mahboob Khan and 3 others 1993 SCMR 2325 and Shahab ud Din and 5 others v. Mir Ali Khan 2001 SCMR 543. Both the Courts thus on this question fell into a legal error. Their findings thus cannot be sustained.????????\n  10. As regards limitation, suffice it to say that the question being mixed question of law and facts, more particularly when the sale mutation was subject to review and there are a number of cutting and over-writings in it. In somewhat similar situation a Full Bench of the apex Court in the judgment reported as Muhammad Shah v. Additional District Judge, Kohat and others 2004 SCMR 535 had declared the revisional order of the District Judge and maintained by this Court in constitutional jurisdiction to be suffering from legal infirmity which could not be sustained and had restored the order of trial Court, directing the parties to prove question of limitation through evidence.\n  11. Thus without going into further details and while getting wisdom from the law settled by august Supreme Court of Pakistan, the judgment/order dated 30-11-2006 passed by revisional Court is declared to be suffering from legal infirmities, which cannot be sustained and accordingly set aside. Consequently, suit is restored and remitted to the trial Court for its decision in accordance with law.\n  12. Plaintiff-petitioner is, however, directed to make up deficiency in the deposit of sale consideration by depositing balance of 1/3rd of Rs.4,06,000 within 30 days from the date of passing of this order, failing which revisional order would stand restored.\n  13. Trial Court is also directed to frame proper issues arising out of the pleadings of the parties, particularly regarding limitation and mutation in question and effect of its review etc. as well as non-compliance of provisions of section 32, Act ibid and its effect.\n  14.

Farmeeda Bibi petitioner, was married to respondent No.3. However, there was no issue as a result of wedlock. Respondent No.3 contracted second marriage and allegedly expelled the petitioner out of his house in three plain clothes. She, therefore, filed a suit for dissolution of marriage as well as recovery of maintenance allowance to the tune of Rs.4,50,000 in the Court of learned Family Judge, Karor, District Layyah who decreed the suit for dissolution of marriage whereas the suit for recovery of maintenance allowance was decreed to the extent of Rs.50,000 only where-against she preferred an appeal before the learned Additional District Judge praying that' it should be enhanced to Rs.1,50,000 by modifying the judgment and decree passed by the learned Courts below. Likewise, an appeal was also filed by respondent No.3 before the learned Additional District Judge who dismissed the appeal filed by respondent No.3, however, partly allowed the appeal of the petitioner by enhancing the decretal amount from Rs.50,000 to Rs.1,00,000 only, where-against both the parties preferred separate constitutional petitions before this Court.\n  2. Writ Petition No.1785 of 2009 filed by respondent No.3 Muhammad Aslam was dismissed vide order dated 14-4-2009 for non-compliance of order dated 13-3-2009 passed by this Court, as well as on merits in limine, with costs throughout.\n  3. This petition was admitted to regular hearing vide order dated 11-3-2009.\n  3A. It is, inter alia contended that both the learned Courts below after having arrived at a conclusion that petitioner/plaintiff discharged her onus of proving the issues concerning her, were left with no lawful justification to decree the suit for a lesser amount; that no grounds whatsoever have been given by both the learned Courts below for not decreeing the suit of the plaintiff to the tune of Rs.1,50,000; that respondent No.3, in fact, ruined the entire life of the petitioner which was initially made miserable by coal-treating her and thereafter by contracting second marriage he multiplied the miseries/agonies of the petitioners who is a woman; that amount in question by no means could be considered as an adequate compensation for the miseries suffered by her and that till date respondent has not paid even a single penny to the petitioner as maintenance allowance which was his legal obligation, thus prays that not only the amount may be enhanced to Rs.1,50,000 only, rather, she may be allowed special costs as she is pursuing her remedy for the last number of years.\n  4. Conversely, the only ground being urged is that respondent is a poor man and not in a position to make the payment of any maintenance allowance.\n  5. Arguments heard. Record perused.\n  6. There are concurrent findings of facts and law arrived at by the learned Courts below. Initially, the learned Family Judge decreed the suit of the petitioner/plaintiff which stood upheld by the learned appellate Court. However, the suit was not decreed as prayed for without any plausible reasons and lawful justification. The minute examination of record leaves no doubts in my mind that petitioner has successfully proved her case, therefore, by all means she was entitled to the grant of decree as prayed for. Needless to add that she has suffered hardships, miseries by the acts of respondent No.3 and for the last number of years has been facing the agony of protracted litigation. Till date even not a single penny has been paid to her. It appears that sole purpose of respondent No.3 is to add to the miseries of the petitioner.\n  7. For what has been discussed above, I allow this petition. Resultantly, the decretal amount is enhanced to Rs.1,50,000 as prayed. In view of peculiar facts and circumstances of the case she is also c allowed costs throughout.\n  8. With these observations, this petition is accepted.\n  H.B.T./F-54/L Petition accepted.",

After conclusion of the trial, the learned Civil Judge, Fatehpur Thakyala decreed the suit of Mst. Channa Bibi, plaintiff/respondent vide judgment and decree dated 22-12-2005. Feeling aggrieved from the afore-said judgment and decree the petitioner/ defendant preferred an appeal before the District Judge on 16-6-2006, which is sub judice before the First Appellate Court.\n  During the pendency of the appeal, the petitioner/defendant moved an application for additional evidence on 16-2-2006. This application was opposed by the opposite side by filing objections. After hearing the parties, the learned District Judge rejected the same vide the impugned judgment and order dated 16-6-2008. Hence this revision petition.\n  Malik Muhammad Yousaf, the learned counsel for the petitioner, vehemently contended that the learned District Judge Kotli fell in error while disallowing the application for additional evidence, as such the impugned order is patently illegal and against the facts, therefore, is not sustainable. According to the learned counsel, the respondent, Mst. Channa Bibi has secretly alienated her whole share through gift-deed dated 13-11-1990, in favour of her sons, Muhammad Saleem and Muhammad Farooq, and when he got knowledge regarding above-mentioned gift-deed, he moved an application for additional evidence to bring on record the gift-deed in question and Misl-e-Haqiat pertaining to year, 1975-1976. He further maintained that the gift deed and Mils-e-Haqiat are public documents and the genuineness of these documents is undisputed, therefore, the same were relevant and just necessary for resolving` the real controversy between the parties. But this important aspect of the case was ignored by the learned District Judge, while passing the impugned order. The learned counsel has referred to 2009 YLR 125 and 2007 SCMR 1117 in support of his contention.\n  While controverting the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner, Ch. Mehboob Ellahi, the learned counsel for the respondent, argued that the impugned order is quite in accordance with law and facts, therefore, same warrants no interference.\n  According to the learned counsel, the documents sought to be produced as additional evidence are public documents and were very much in the knowledge of the petitioner/defendant at the time of institution of the suit, therefore, the petitioner/defendant has wrongly pleaded and agitated that these documents came to his knowledge at the subsequent stage of .appeal. Alternatively, it has been contended by the learned counsel that documents in question have no relevancy with the controversy between the parties as such the petitioner intends to bring on record these documents only to fill up the lacunas. The learned counsel placed reliance on the following authorities 2006 SCR 188 PLD 2004 SC (AJ&K) 35.\n  I have given due consideration to the matter and gone through the impugned judgment/order as well as case-law referred to herein above.\n  A careful perusal of the record shows that the declaratory suit with prayer for possession and annulment of mutation was filed on the grounds that mutation in question regarding inheritance of one Ditta, deceased had been wrongly sanctioned in the name of Mst. Anwar Bibi and the petitioner herein. After settlement of issues and affording them opportunity of producing evidence, the trial Court decreed the suit filed by Mst. Channa Bibi, respondent herein. After the lapse of a considerable time, at the stage of first appeal, the petitioner/defendant moved an application for bringing on record the gift-deed dated 30-11-1990, and a copy of Misl-e-Haqiat pertaining to years, 1975-1976 as additional evidence. It is also to be noted here that petitioner/defendant has simply pleaded in his application that he came to know about the gift deed in question after the judgment of the trial Court.\n  In my estimation, the explanation given and pleaded by the petitioner is not plausible and is unconvincing because the gift-deed was executed on 30-11-1990, whereas the suit was filed on 30-7-2005. Therefore, how it could be said that a public document had been executed and registered secretly. It is also pertinent to mention here that the petitioner/defendant did not furnish any explanation with regard to non-production of Misl-e-Haqiat at the time of evidence.\n  Undoubtedly, under Order XLI, rule 27, C.P.C. a document can be produced or any witness can be examined as additional evidence to enable the Court to pronounce the judgment, but at the same time the above quoted provision of law imposes an embargo that this rule applies only where, additional evidence is required by the Court. It would be useful to reproduce the relevant rule, which reads as under:---\n  \"27. (a) -----------------------------------------------------\n  (b) The appellate Court requires any document to be produced or any witness to be examined to enable it to pronounce judgment, or for any other substantial cause, the appellate Court may allow such evidence or document to be produced, or witness to be examined\"\n  From the bare reading of the above referred rule it can safely be said that the power to allow additional evidence is discretionary in nature. Such power can be exercised by the appellate Court itself and not by a party to appeal. Thus, the impression can easily be gathered from the impugned judgment that the first appellate Court did not feel any necessity that in absence of documents referred to herein above; it cannot pronounce the judgment. The reliance may be pleaded on a reported judgment of the apex Court in case titled Noor Begum and others v. Muhammad Shareef and others 1994 SCR 238.\n  In the light of dictum laid down by the apex Court in above-referred report, I feel no hesitation in holding that no sufficient or good cause has been shown by the petitioner for producing the additional evidence. The case-law referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioner has no nexus with the case in hand due to distinct facts and circumstances.\n  The upshot of the above discussion is that finding no force in this revision petition, same stands dismissed.

The facts as disclosed in the plaint are that Asghar Ali-defendant No.3 was owner in possession of the suit-land measuring 3 Kanals, 8 Marlas and land measuring 4 Kanals, 12 Marlas falling in Khasra No.186, situated in the revenue estate of Mouza Attawa Tehsil and District Gujranwala. Defendant No.3 executed a General Power of Attorney in favour of defendant No.4-M.A. Mazhar by which he was empowered to alienate the land measuring 1 Kanal, 1 Marla and one Sarsai in the name of defendant No.5 in the suit. Sale-deed is shown to have been registered on 18-2-1986. Defendant No.5 sold the above said land to the plaintiffs through a registered sale-deed dated 10-4-1991; whereafter it was surrounded by a boundary wall and the construction was raised thereon. In due course of time, there arose some irritant issue and the matter was reported to the police for an action against the suitors, which necessitated instituting the suit. Defendant No.3 also transferred some land in favour of defendant No.5 vide registered sale-deed dated 18-2-1986 in which Khasra No.185 was shown in place of Khasra No.186 inadvertently. The suit was fundamentally filed under section 39 of the Specific Relief Act for rectification of the sale-deed. The averments contained in the plaint were emphatically denied being incorrect and divergent pleadings of the parties gave rise to the following issues:--\n  (1) Whether the property purchased by the plaintiffs is situated in Khasra No.186 not in 185? OPP\n  (2) Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree for declaration along with mandatory and prohibitory injunction on the grounds mentioned in the plaint? OPD\n  (3) Whether the plaintiffs have no cause of action? OPD\n  (4) Whether the defendants Nos.3 and 4 are unnecessary parties? OPD 3-4\n  (5) Whether the suit of the plaintiffs is barred by law of limitation? OPD\n  (6) Whether the suit has not been properly valued for the purpose of Court fee? OPD\n  (7) Whether the plaintiffs are estopped by their words and conduct to file this suit? OPD\n  (8) Relief.\n  On conclusion of trial, the learned trial Judge vide judgment and decree dated 30-11-2004 decreed the suit in favour of the respondents. An appeal taken against the said judgment and decree before the learned Additional District Judge failed on 17-2-2005.\n  3. Learned counsel for the petitioners argued that both the Courts below misread and misinterpreted the evidence available on the file. Bitterly argued that section 31 of the Specific Relief Act has a limited scope and the rectification could only be made with consent of the vendor and not otherwise.\n  4. Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents contended that under section 31 ibid, the Court enjoys ample jurisdiction to correct the error, if there was, in the registered sale-deed. Further argued that no misreading and non-reading is available in the impugned judgments recorded by both the Courts below.\n  5. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at some considerable length.\n  6. Exh.P.15 in the case is an important document. By the said sale-deed, the land was sold in favour of respondent No.5 which finds. mentioned in Khasra No.185 but the description given in the deed shows presence of 15 feet street towards South and 20 feet towards East of 9 Marlas plot, In the similar manner, D(11.P.16 is a copy of the sale-deed by which land was sold to respondent No.5 measuring 12 Marlas, 3 Sarsai which discernibly shows Bazar 20 feet on its North and East. Sale-deed Exh. P.17 made by respondent No.5 in favour of the petitioners is about 1 Kanal, 1 Marla and 3 Sarsai having 25 feet Bazar in its North and 25 feet street in its South, 20 feet Bazar in East and house towards the West side. The above description shown in the various sale deeds tally with the property owned and possessed by respondent No.1. The evidence by both the Courts below has fully been scanned with due care and cautions who came to the conclusion that the property in dispute is situated in Khasra No.186 and necessary correction shall be made and Khasra No.186 shall be written in place of Khasra No.185.\n  7. The proposition of law is too settled to admit any debate that if there is any contradiction found in the actual position and Khasra number, it is the description given in the sale-deed which will prevail and not the actual Khasra number. Similar question came up for consideration before this Court in Fazal Hussain and another v. Abdul Hamid PLD 1971 Lah. 89 in which it was held that if there is any contradiction or difference between the actual Khasra number and the description of the property, surely the description given in the sale-deed will prevail. The relevant portion of the judgment reads:---\n  \"The emphasis in this rule is on the identification of the property and it has never been held that a suit should be dismissed or that a plaint should be rejected on account of any alleged \"insufficient description\"--See Rani Hemanta Kumari Debi v. The Secretary of State for India-in-Council (3), Kazem Sheik and others v. Danesh Sheik (4), Jaladhar Mandal v. Kinoo Mandal (5), Syed Reza Ali v.

Shama Nando Das Chowdhury and others (9) and Nasir Mea v. Arman Ali Mea and others (10). Again in this case -even though the plaintiff did not file the site-plan the same was filed 'by the contesting defendants and, as such, the objection cannot be given any serious consideration. So far as the boundaries etc., are concerned, even though they do not figure in the plaint nevertheless it cannot be said that the defendants were under any mistake as to the identification of the suit plot.\n  (1) PLD 1970 SC 63, (2) AIR 1960 SC 941, (3) (1906) 3 CLJ 561 (PC), (4) (1897) 1 CWN 574, (5) (1897) 1 CWN 189, (6) (1870)14 SWR 474, (7) (1903) 7 CWN 615, (8) AIR 1920 Pat. 82, (9) ILR 26 Cal 845, (10) (1913) 18 IC 745.\"\n  8. In the case in hand, sufficient evidence has been brought on the record to establish that the respondents are in possession of the house which is surrounded by the boundary walls and the Pacca construction has been raised thereon. Mere fact that in the sale-deed, incorrect Khasra number was mentioned, would not disentitle the respondents to retain the residential property owned and possessed by them. I am also fortified in my view by Muhammad Rafique v. Amar Shahzad 1999 YLR 610. Both the Courts below have minutely seen the matter and the issue involved has been determined by scanning the evidence with microscopic vision. The case has been examined with the parameters provided by section 115, C.P.C. This is a case of concurrent finding of fact and interference in exercise of jurisdiction under section 115, C.P.C. is not possible. Reference may be made to Anwar Zaman and 5 others v. Bahadur Sher and others 2000 SCMR 431 and Abdul Rahim and another v. Mrs. Janntay Bibi and 13 others 2000 SCMR 346. The judgments and decrees of both the Courts below are rich in detail. The Herculean efforts made by the learned counsel for the petitioners could not display the Himalayan existence that the respondents are in possession of the residential property which was sold to them and it is surrounded by boundary walls and Pacca construction raised thereon.\n  9. For whatever has been stated above, the petition has no merit and the same is dismissed, however, the parties are left to bear their own costs.\n  H.B.T./S-121/L Petition dismissed.",

An objection was raised by the Counsel for the private respondents that the Revision Application ought to have been filed in the District Court and not directly in the High Court against the impugned order. Learned counsel for the applicant in reply submitted that section 115, C.P.C. confers concurrent jurisdiction upon the High Court as well as the District Court to entertain Revision Application and that it is a matter of choice of an aggrieved party. In support of his submission he has relied upon the cases reported in 1993 SCMR 618, PLD 1991 Lah, 314, 1988 CLC 1812 and PLD 1995 Lah. 15.??????\n  Learned counsel for private respondents apart from raising the preliminary objection as noted above has further contended that there are disputed facts regarding claim of ownership of the land and such facts cannot be decided without recording of evidence. In support of his submissions he has relied upon the cases reported in PLD 1980 Revenue 27, 1984 SCMR 228 and 1991 MLD 345. On the point of maintainability of Revision, he has relied upon the case reported in 2001 CLC 200 and contended that in exceptional cases the Revision Application may directly be filed in the High Court and not ordinarily.\n  Learned Additional Advocate-General Sindh has supported the impugned order contended that the Civil Court has jurisdiction in the matter and the dispute raised in the plaint requires recording of evidence.\n  It appears that the private respondents have filed a First Class Suit No.50 of 2008 (New F.C.S. No.293 of 2008) in the Court of Vth Senior Civil Judge, Hyderabad, for Declaration, Mandatory and Permanent Injunction challenging the order dated 15-3-2008 passed by the Executive District Officer (Revenue)/Land Commissioner Matiari, whereby he has cancelled Entries Nos.170 and 171 dated 8-11-1966 existing in the name of Umar son of Wali Muhammad and Muhammad son of Wali Muhammad. The private respondents claim themselves to be predecessor of Umar and Muhammad and they have pleaded that they are the owners and in cultivating possession of the 1cnd in question. It appears that in respect of the property in question earlier Suit No.812/1959 was filed by Umar son of Wali Muhammad against Muhammad Ali Shah and another in the Court of Sub-Civil Judge, Hyderabad for Declaration and Injunction and such suit through ex parte judgment dated 30-1-1960 was decreed. The effect of such ex parte judgment appears to be that the plaintiff in the said suit was declared as owner of the land in question. Subsequently, on 5-12-1966 an order was passed by the Assistant Rehabilitation Mukhtiarkar and A.S.C. (Land) Hyderabad District Hyderabad, by which it was noted that the original copy of decree passed in Civil Suit No.812/1959 has not been produced and even if such be taken to be correct, the land in question will remain on the Khata of an Evacuee. He therefore maintained that the existing allotment in favour of the predecessor of the applicant cannot be cancelled. It further appears that another order dated 9-7-1966 was passed by the Assistant Rehabilitation Mukhtiarkar and A.S.C. (Land) Hyderabad District Hyderabad, whereby one Muhammad Ali was informed that the allotment of suit-land has already been cancelled from the name of Syed Mushtaque Hussain, the predecessor of the applicant pursuant to Additional Custodian (Judicial) of Evacuee property Karachi's Order dated 2-6-1961 passed in Appeal No.23 of 1961.\n  Further as noted above, through suo motu order dated 15-4-2008 the entries have been cancelled from the name of Umar by the Executive District Officer Revenue Matiari. Private respondents claim to be in possession of the suit property which act is not disputed by the applicant with an addition that such possession of the private respondents is on the basis of a Lease given by the predecessor of the applicant to the predecessor of the private respondents.\n  There being disputed facts regarding the title suit property, apparently, the same will require recording of evidence in the suit. So far the question of jurisdiction is concerned, section 53 of the Land Revenue Act, 1967 is as follow:--\n  53. Suit for declaratory decrees by persons aggrieved by an entry in a record.- If any person considers himself aggrieved by an entry in a record-of-rights [or in a periodical record] as to any right of which he is in possession, he may institute a suit for a declaration of his right under Chapter VI of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (Act 1 of 1877).\n  The reading of the above provision shows that a person who is aggrieved by a entry in the record of rights and claims right of which he is in possession can institute a suit for declaration of his right under I Chapter VI of the Specific Relief Act, 1877.\n  The Private respondents who are plaintiffs in the suit have claimed right and possession of the suit property and are aggrieved of cancellation of entry from record of rights and therefore, in my view, the provision of section 53 as noted above will squarely be attracted to the facts and circumstances of the case and the suit will not be barred under section 172 of the Land Revenue Act, which also makes exception to the provision of section 53.\n  As regards the maintainability of the Revision Application, as the counsel for the private respondents has himself conceded that the Revision Application can be filed directly in the High Court against an order in exceptional cases, this in itself amounts to negating the objection raised by the counsel for private respondents. In any case, I have gone through the provisions of section 115 of C.P.C. and find that it gives concurrent jurisdiction to the High Court as well as the District Court to entertain Revision Applications against the order passed by the Courts subordinate to it. Subsection (2) of section 115, C.P.C. is the provision by which such concurrent jurisdiction is conferred upon the District Court, but such conferment of concurrent jurisdiction is limited where the amount or value of subject matter does not exceed the limits of its appellate jurisdiction. This being limitation ,s placed upon the District Court for entertaining the Revision Application, it has no application to the High Court nor such provision takes away the jurisdiction of the High Court from entertaining the Revision Application against the order passed by a Court subordinate to it. For these reasons I find this revision Application to be maintainable.\n  However, as on merits, I have already stated above that the suit filed by the Private Respondents is not barred by law, consequently I find no merit in this Revision Application which, after hearing the learned counsel for the parties, by a short order passed today was dismissed.

The facts in brief are that the petitioner filed a suit for possession through pre-emption of the land measuring 60 Kanals, 19 Marlas, fully described in the plaint. It was averred that the vendor sold land to the respondent through registered deed bearing No.618 dated 26-6-1997 for consideration of Rs.11,73,000 but with a view to defeat the perspective pre-emption suit, fictitious amount of Rs.22,50,000 has been shown in the sale-deed. Petitioner claimed that he had a superior right of pre-emption. In para. No.3 of the plaint, it was explained that he got knowledge through Nadir Khan son of Bilal Khan on 23-8-1997 at about 9-00 a.m. who disclosed the factum of sale and at the same time, without losing a moment even, made Talb-i-Muwathibat (jumping demand) and then the remaining formalities were completed; whereafter the other Talbs were performed in a mode prescribed by law. In the written statement, the averments of the plaint were empathically denied. In the preliminary objection it was claimed that the suit was time-barred and that the petitioner-suitor was estopped by his own conduct and performance. On facts and merits, it was claimed that the notice of Talb-I-Ishhad was not given and it was not received by the respondent-vendee and the requisite performance of Talbs are non-existent. Divergent pleadings of the parties gave rise to the following issues:---\n  (1) Whether the plaintiff has got superior right to pre-empt the suit-land? OPP\n  (2) Whether the plaintiff has performed Talbs in accordance with law? OPP\n  (3) Whether ostensible sale price of Rs.22,50,000 was fixed and paid in good faith as consideration of the suit-land? OPD\n  (4) What is market value of the suit-land? OPPs.\n  (5) Whether the defendant is entitled to get incidental, charges in case the suit is decreed? If so to what extent? OPD\n  (6) Whether the plaintiff has got no cause of action and locus standi to bring this suit? OPD\n  (7) Whether the plaintiff is estopped by his word and conduct to institute this suit? OPD\n  (8) Whether the suit does not lie? OPD\n  (9) Whether the suit is time-barred? OPD\n  (10) Whether the plaintiff has not deposited Zar-i-Suem as ordered by the Court: If so, its effect? OPD\n  (11) Whether the suit is not properly valued for the purposes of Court fee? OPD\n  (12) Whether the plaintiff has waived his right of pre-emption? OPD\n  (13) Whether the suit is false, based on mala fide and the defendant is entitled to get special costs? OPD\n  (4) Relief.\n  Issues Nos.1 and 2 are the core issues in the whole case. Onus of these two issues was proposed upon the plaintiff. While returning finding on issue No.2, the learned trial Judge came to the conclusion that the necessary Talbs have been performed in accordance with law and nothing has been brought out on record by the defendant to reach at a conclusion that there was some lacuna or error in completing the said formalities necessary to be done by law. Issue No.1 in respect of superior right was also answered in favour of the petitioner by having held that according to the Jamabandi for 1993-1994 Exh.P.3, the suitor is Shareek Khata. Issues Nos.3 and 6 to 13 were also answered against the defendant. Onus of issue No.4 was proposed upon both parties and it was held that the market price has been correctly shown as Rs.22,50,000 in the sale-deed. On issue No.5, it was held that the vendee is entitled to receive apart from the amount shown in the deed, the necessary expenses incurred by the vendee and he is also entitled to receive an amount of Rs.20,02,500 from the petitioner. In nutshell, the suit was decreed subject to deposit of Rs.22,50,000 and the incidental charges as determined under issue No.5. An appeal was taken against the said judgment and decree by the vendee which was accepted by the learned Additional District Judge vide his judgment and decree dated 17-7-2003.\n  3. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that the learned Additional District Judge while passing the impugned judgment and decree based his decision on extraneous considerations and the conclusion drawn by him is running counter to the evidence available on the record. Further argued that Talb-I-Ishhad and all the necessary Talbs were performed in accordance with law but the learned Additional District Judge while passing the impugned judgment and decree altogether set up a new case to the advantage of the vendee-respondent which even otherwise is not available on the record.\n  4. Conversely, the learned counsel for the respondent argued that the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned Additional District Judge is rich in detail and came out with the plea that the Talb-I -Ishhad was not performed according to the requirements and standard fixed in section 13(1)(b) of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991.\n  5. I have given conscious thought to the arguments made by learned counsel for the parties and with their able assistance have gone through the record available before me.\n  6. The learned Additional District Judge while reversing decree of the trial Court, focused his decision on the point that the sale-deed was made through a registered instrument and the witnesses admitted that all the villagers knew the registration of the sale-deed. It was emphasized that since all villagers knew with regard to the date of sale-deed., the necessary presumption would be that the petitioner had a notice of the sale transaction on 26-7-1993' but .he sent a notice on 26-8-1997. The stance taken by the suitor that he gained knowledge on 23-8-1997 was held to be incorrect. Concluding paragraph 10 of the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge is relevant which is reproduced: ---\n  \"It is an admitted fact that the sale made through a registered sale-deed and the P.W.3, P.W.4 and P.W.5, all have admitted that all the villagers knew at the time of registration of the sale-deed that the property had been sold out means that at the time of registered sale-deed i.e. 26-7-1997, all the villagers knew that the property had been sold and the plaintiff/respondent sent a notice on 26-8-1997 whereas he had said that he came to have the knowledge of the sale-deed on 23-8-1997 which fact is not supported by his own evidence if all the villagers knew that the property had been sold through registered sale-deed at the time of registration of the sale-deed i.e. on 26-6-1997 then it is not possible considering our set up of villages' life style that plaintiff/respondent could not had got the knowledge of the sale-deed.\"\n  7. From the bare perusal of the whole judgment passed by the learned Additional District Judge, one thing is pertinent that the main reason which weighed with him in passing the said judgment was that Photostat copy of the notice has been brought on the record which was not believed to be correct and it was held that it may not be the same notice, which the suitor-pre-emptor sent to the vendee. There is no denying of the fact that the postal receipt is available on the record and clerk of the postal Department to prove the execution of the receipt appeared in the witness box as P.W. photocopy of the notice sent to the respondent the witnesses of which have been produced in evidence, could not be said to be a copy other than the one dispatched to the addressee. On the face of this situation that when the receipt of the postal Department which was provided to be unambiguous evidence of P.W.1 a strong presumption arises that the notice must have been received by the addressee and if some one has not received the notice and the same was returned in original for any reason, the petitioner-suitor cannot be blamed. This question came up for consideration in Hameedullah Khan and others v. Mst. Zeenat Khatoon 2008 SCMR 1444 wherein the apex Court concluded the issue by having held that photo copy of the notice brought on the record was sufficient evidence to determine that Talb-i-Ishhad has been performed and the photo copy can be accepted as a valid truth. The relevant portion of the judgment reads:---\n  \"We have heard learned counsel for the petitioners and have also gone through the impugned judgment as well as the case-law being relied upon by the learned counsel. It is to be noted that as far as P.W. Zeenat Khatoon is concerned, she has tendered copy of notice which was in her possession, after sending the original to the petitioners, therefore, in our opinion, the Court was legally right to accept its Photostat copy and on this score, no point is made out for grant of leave to appeal. The judgment being relied upon by the learned counsel is distinguishable, .in view of the facts and circumstances of instant case\".\n  Ghulam Abbas and another v. Manzoor Ahmad and another 2008 SCMR 1366 and Khuda Bakhsh v. Muhammad Yaqoob and others 1981 SCMR 179 are also quoted with advantage.\n  8. Learned Additional District Judge in my considered view has altogether set up a new case to the advantage of respondent-vendee which otherwise is not spelled out from the record. The evidence on the point of Talb-i-Muwathibat is consistent and there is no discrepancy in it. The presumption drawn by the learned Additional District Judge that since other people of village had got knowledge, it does not mean that the petitioner had also knowledge of the sale. Knowledge of other persons cannot be presumed to be a knowledge of the suitor. This is for the first time, a new interpretation of section 13(1) of the Punjab Pre-emption Act has been brought on the record. The impugned judgment and decree in any case is not sustainable at law.\n  9. For what has been stated above, the revision petition is accepted with costs and the impugned judgment and decree dated 17-7-2003 passed by the learned Additional District Judge are set aside with costs and that of the learned trial Court dated 29-11-2002 are restored.\n  H.B.T./S-120/L Petition accepted.",

On issue No.5, it was held that the vendee is entitled to receive apart from the amount shown in the deed, the necessary expenses incurred by the vendee and he is also entitled to receive an amount of Rs.20,02,500 from the petitioner. In nutshell, the suit was decreed subject to deposit of Rs.22,50,000 and the incidental charges as determined under issue No.5. An appeal was taken against the said judgment and decree by the vendee which was accepted by the learned Additional District Judge vide his judgment and decree dated 17-7-2003.\n ",
      "case_judgement": "Learned Additional District Judge in my considered view has altogether set up a new case to the advantage of respondent-vendee which otherwise is not spelled out from the record. The evidence on the point of Talb-i-Muwathibat is consistent and there is no discrepancy in it. The presumption drawn by the learned Additional District Judge that since other people of village had got knowledge, it does not mean that the petitioner had also knowledge of the sale. Knowledge of other persons cannot be presumed to be a knowledge of the suitor. This is for the first time, a new interpretation of section 13(1) of the Punjab Pre-emption Act has been brought on the record. The impugned judgment and decree in any case is not sustainable at law.\n  9. For what has been stated above, the revision petition is accepted with costs and the impugned judgment and decree dated 17-7-2003 passed by the learned Additional District Judge are set aside with costs and that of the learned trial Court dated 29-11-2002 are restored.\n  H.B.T./S-120/L Petition accepted.",
      "case_proceddings": "Learned counsel for the petitioner states that the learned Additional District Judge while passing the impugned judgment and decree based his decision on extraneous considerations and the conclusion drawn by him is running counter to the evidence available on the record. Further argued that Talb-I-Ishhad and all the necessary Talbs were performed in accordance with law but the learned Additional District Judge while passing the impugned judgment and decree altogether set up a new case to the advantage of the vendee-respondent which even otherwise is not available on the record.\n  4. Conversely, the learned counsel for the respondent argued that the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned Additional District Judge is rich in detail and came out with the plea that the Talb-I -Ishhad was not performed according to the requirements and standard fixed in section 13(1)(b) of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991.\n  5. I have given conscious thought to the arguments made by learned counsel for the parties and with their able assistance have gone through the record available before me.\n  6. The learned Additional District Judge while reversing decree of the trial Court, focused his decision on the point that the sale-deed was made through a registered instrument and the witnesses admitted that all the villagers knew the registration of the sale-deed. It was emphasized that since all villagers knew with regard to the date of sale-deed., the necessary presumption would be that the petitioner had a notice of the sale transaction on 26-7-1993' but .he sent a notice on 26-8-1997. The stance taken by the suitor that he gained knowledge on 23-8-1997 was held to be incorrect. Concluding paragraph 10 of the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge is relevant which is reproduced: ---\n  \"It is an admitted fact that the sale made through a registered sale-deed and the P.W.3, P.W.4 and P.W.5, all have admitted that all the villagers knew at the time of registration of the sale-deed that the property had been sold out means that at the time of registered sale-deed i.e. 26-7-1997, all the villagers knew that the property had been sold and the plaintiff/respondent sent a notice on 26-8-1997 whereas he had said that he came to have the knowledge of the sale-deed on 23-8-1997 which fact is not supported by his own evidence if all the villagers knew that the property had been sold through registered sale-deed at the time of registration of the sale-deed i.e. on 26-6-1997 then it is not possible considering our set up of villages' life style that plaintiff/respondent could not had got the knowledge of the sale-deed.\"\n  7. From the bare perusal of the whole judgment passed by the learned Additional District Judge, one thing is pertinent that the main reason which weighed with him in passing the said judgment was that Photostat copy of the notice has been brought on the record which was not believed to be correct and it was held that it may not be the same notice, which the suitor-pre-emptor sent to the vendee. There is no denying of the fact that the postal receipt is available on the record and clerk of the postal Department to prove the execution of the receipt appeared in the witness box as P.W. photocopy of the notice sent to the respondent the witnesses of which have been produced in evidence, could not be said to be a copy other than the one dispatched to the addressee. On the face of this situation that when the receipt of the postal Department which was provided to be unambiguous evidence of P.W.1 a strong presumption arises that the notice must have been received by the addressee and if some one has not received the notice and the same was returned in original for any reason, the petitioner-suitor cannot be blamed. This question came up for consideration in Hameedullah Khan and others v. Mst. Zeenat Khatoon 2008 SCMR 1444 wherein the apex Court concluded the issue by having held that photo copy of the notice brought on the record was sufficient evidence to determine that Talb-i-Ishhad has been performed and the photo copy can be accepted as a valid truth. The relevant portion of the judgment reads:---\n  \"We have heard learned counsel for the petitioners and have also gone through the impugned judgment as well as the case-law being relied upon by the learned counsel. It is to be noted that as far as P.W. Zeenat Khatoon is concerned, she has tendered copy of notice which was in her possession, after sending the original to the petitioners, therefore, in our opinion, the Court was legally right to accept its Photostat copy and on this score, no point is made out for grant of leave to appeal. The judgment being relied upon by the learned counsel is distinguishable, .in view of the facts and circumstances of instant case\".\n  Ghulam Abbas and another v. Manzoor Ahmad and another 2008 SCMR 1366 and Khuda Bakhsh v. Muhammad Yaqoob and others 1981 SCMR 179 are also quoted with advantage.\n  8. Learned Additional District Judge in my considered view has altogether set up a new case to the advantage of respondent-vendee which otherwise is not spelled out from the record. The evidence on the point of Talb-i-Muwathibat is consistent and there is no discrepancy in it. The presumption drawn by the learned Additional District Judge that since other people of village had got knowledge, it does not mean that the petitioner had also knowledge of the sale. Knowledge of other persons cannot be presumed to be a knowledge of the suitor. This is for the first time, a new interpretation of section 13(1) of the Punjab Pre-emption Act has been brought on the record. The impugned judgment and decree in any case is not sustainable at law.",

Consequently, hearing of this petition was put off for hearing the arguments of both the parties on the said point.\n  2. Learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the petitioner had failed to furnish the list of witnesses along with their affidavits while filing the Election Petition, however, just after framing the issues by this Tribunal the list of witnesses. along with the gist of their evidence was duly submitted in the office on 28-4-2009 and after receiving the said list and receipt of the required expenditures for\nsummoning the official witnesses the office had issued summons to the said witnesses, therefore, the objection raised by respondent No.1 is not sustainable in law. He adds that provisions of C.P.C. are fully applicable during the trial of election petitions; that under Order XVI, rule 1, C.P.C., once the issues are settled the petitioner can furnish a list of the witnesses for calling, either to give evidence or to produce documents; that the petitioner has furnished the list of witnesses in the light of the said provisions of the C.P.C., therefore, the objection raised by learned counsel for respondent No.1 is misconceived; that the provisions as contained in the Notification dated 16-3-1985 issued by Election Commission of Pakistan are not mandatory in nature, therefore, the election petition cannot be dismissed for the non-compliance of the said provisions; that the said Notification is a subordinate legislation, therefore, will not control the powers of the Tribunal, as Civil Court, conferred on it in terms of section 64 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976; that after entertaining the election petition filed by the petitioner his failure to submit the list of witnesses along with their affidavits has been impliedly condoned by the Election Commission of Pakistan ; that under section 63 (ibid), the election petition can only be dismissed for the non-compliance of provisions of sections 54 and 55 of the Act, whereas, there is no provision in the said Act justifying the dismissal of the election petition due to the failure of the petitioner to submit list of witnesses along with their affidavits. In support of his contentions learned counsel has placed reliance on the cases of Engineer Jameel Ahmed Malik v. Ghulam Sarwar Khan and 6 others 2004 CLC 914, Ihsanul Haq v. Dr. Saddique Hussain and another 1995 CLC 382, Rai Asghar Ali Khan v. Returning officer and others 1999 CLC 565 and Sardar Akhtar Ali v. Wasim Ahmed 1992 CLC 1437.\n  3. Conversely, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 has reiterated his objection by submitting that the provisions as contained in the afore-said Notification, which has been issued under section 62 of the Act, are mandatory in nature; that under section 62 every election petition has to be tried in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Election Commission, therefore, the provisions of C.P.C. are not applicable during the trial of election petition; that the petitioner cannot be allowed to violate the provisions of the said Notification only on the ground that the Election Commission of Pakistan had failed to raise the relevant objection at the time of entertaining the election petition. In order to share up his contentions learned counsel for respondent No.1 has placed reliance on the cases of Mir Tariq Mahmood Khan Khetran and others v. Mir Baz Muhammad Khetran and others 1992 CLC 1766, Ihrar Khattak v. Mian Muzaffar Shah and others 1991 CLC 175 and Sardar Khalid Nawaz v. Mian Manzoor Ahmed Wattoo 1987 CLC 1167.\n  4. Heard. Record perused.\n  5. Admittedly, while filing election petition the petitioner failed to submit a list of witnesses. However after framing of issues, the petitioner filed the list of witnesses along with gist of their statements in the office on 28-4-2009. There is also no denying the fact that before submitting the said application the petitioner did not seek any permission from this Tribunal for the submission of the said list.\n  6. Before proceeding further I would like to survey the relevant provisions of law, which would help rendering proper decision on this application. Chapter-VII of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 furnishes provisions for the settlement of election disputes, the election petition is filed under section 52, the procedure for presentation of the election petition has been given in section 53, whereas section 54 outlines the parties to be arrayed as respondents in the election petition. Section 55 provides a guideline to the election petitioner regarding the contents of the election petition including the prayer which can be made while submitting the election petition. Section 62 is most relevant for resolving the issue under debate. Under this provision of law every election petition shall be tried in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Election Commission. The said section was amended on 17th of March, 1985. Before the amendment subsection (1) of section 62 of the Act provided as under:\n  62. Procedure before Tribunal.--- (1) Subject to the provisions of the Act and the rules every election petition shall be tried as nearly as made may be in accordance with procedure for the trial of suit under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act .V of 1908) . \"\n  After amendment it reads as under:-\n  62. Procedure before Tribunal.--- Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules every election petition shall be tried in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Election Commission.\"\n  The powers of Tribunal have been prescribed under section 64 of the Act, according to which the Tribunal shall have the powers of a Civil Court trying a suit under the C.P.C. Section 63 lays down parameters for the dismissal of the election petition due to the failure of the compliance of certain provisions of the Act. Admittedly, under the said section failure to comply with the provisions of above-mentioned notification cannot be made a ground for the dismissed of an election petition. It is also true that the said Notification is a subordinate legislation, therefore, it does not control the powers of the Tribunal as Civil Court. Therefore, the law laid down in all the cases cited by learned counsel for the petitioner is fully applicable to the extent that the election petition cannot be dismissed by the Tribunal for failure of the compliance of the provisions of the said Notification.\n  7. Now, the question remains as to whether the petitioner can be allowed to produce the witnesses mentioned in his list of witnesses. Having said that the election petition cannot be dismissed due to the failure of the compliance of the said provisions of law, I would like to mention here that provisions of C.P.C. are not stricto sensu applicable during the trial of the election petition. It is true that under section 64 of the Act this Tribunal is armed with all the powers of a civil Court trying a civil suit under C.P.C. but as mentioned above, in the light of amended section 62 of the Act every election petition has to be decided in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Election Commission. In subsection (1) of section 62 the word \"shall\" has been used by the Legislature. The enactment of the said provision is not without any purpose, rather the purpose is that the election petitions should be decided expeditiously without being entangled in the lengthy procedure. The purpose of the filing of the affidavits of the witnesses obviously is that during the trial the consumption of time in recording the examination-in-chief of the said witnesses can be avoided. For the said purpose, even the framing of the issues is not necessary as has been held by the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Jam Mashooq Ali v. Shahnawaz Junejo 1996 SCMR 426. In the said case it was further held as under:-\n  \"The perusal of section 62, before the afore-mentioned amendment and after amendment together with the procedure prescribed by the Election Commission clearly shows that for the trial of Election Petitions the legislature intended to do away with lengthy procedure prescribed under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908). Reading section 62 as amended and section 64 of the Act, the possible harmonious interpretation thereof would be, that the Election Tribunal shall have all the powers of a Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure except for the trial of Election petitions, where the Election Tribunal shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Election Commission.\"\n  8. A perusal of Notification No.F.1(6)85-Cord. further shows that the said Notification is not that of general policy of realm, but it confers a valuable right and privilege on respondent to know the documents relied upon by the petitioner, the names of the witnesses which he intends to produce before he is called upon to file written statement. So, mere delivery of the petition to the respondent without documents and the affidavits of the witnesses mentioned in clauses (1) and (3) of the Notification will not serve the object of section 62.\n  9. As has been held above, though the Tribunal shall have all the powers of Civil Court trying a civil suit under the Code of Civil.. Procedure, 1908 but the Tribunal is not bound to follow the procedure as given in the C.P.C. for the trial of election petitions, rather, under section 62 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 the Tribunal shall proceed with the trial of the election petitions according to the procedure laid down by the Election Commission of Pakistan as envisaged in the above-mentioned Notification. Further, the Tribunals have been set up under the special law, the purpose of which, as observed' above, is to dispose of election petitions expeditiously and to avoid lengthy procedure as provided in C.P.C. It is true that while entertaining the election petition the Election Commission of Pakistan did not raise any objection regarding the failure of the petitioner to append the list of witnesses along with their affidavits but that would not mean that the petitioner has been indirectly allowed to produce the list of witnesses according to his desires. At the time of entertaining the election petition the Election Commission of Pakistan cannot scrutinize the petitions extensively. According to sub-clause (1) of the Notification, it is always left in the discretion of the election petitioner to rely upon the documents and the affidavits of the witnesses likely to be produced by him. It is the election petitioner himself who is to decide and select the documents and the witnesses intended to be produced by him during the trial. A perusal of the sub-clauses (5) and (6) of the said Notification would be advantageous, therefore, the same are reproduced as under:--\n  (5) Where any party desires to summon any official witness he shall file with the petition a list of such witnesses justifying his production and also mention the documents, if any, which are required to be proved through such witness.\n  (6) No witness whose name is not mentioned in the petition shall be summoned or examined unless required by the Tribunal.\n  Under sub-clause (5) of the said Notification official witnesses can only be summoned if the list of the said witnesses justifying their production stands attached with the election petition. Similarly, under clause (6) of the said Notification no witness whose name is not mentioned in the petition shall be summoned or examined, unless required by the Tribunal.\n  10. Now, considering the case in the said backdrop I find that while filing the election petition the petitioner failed to give the list of witnesses, private or official, along with the election petition. However, affidavits of certain polling agents/private witnesses have been filed along with the election petition, therefore, failure to give list of witnesses of the people whose affidavits have been attached along with this petition would not be prejudicial to the election petitioner and the said witnesses can be produced by the petitioner in his evidence and barring the said witnesses the petitioner cannot be allowed to produce any other private witness.\n  11. Insofar as official witnesses are concerned, surely the petitioner was not required to file their affidavits along with the petition. However, having failed to append. the list of said witnesses along with the election petition, at this stage the petitioner cannot be allowed to produce the official witnesses without specific permission of the Tribunal, but the petitioner has failed to submit any application seeking the permission to produce the said witnesses.\n  12. Consequently, the objection raised by the learned counsel for the respondent to the said extent is upheld with an observation that the petitioner can move, an application giving the reasons justifying the production of the official witnesses and the documents, if any, intended to be produced and provide by the petitioner through the said witnesses and if such an application is filed the same would, of course, be decided after considering all the pros and cons of the matter.\n  13. Now to come up on 14-9-2009 for recording of evidence of the petitioner.\n  M.H./A-264/L Order accordingly.",

      "case_facts": "On the basis of pleadings of the parties the issues were framed on 24-4-2009 and the case was adjourned for recording petitioner's evidence on 20-5-2009 but on the said date the petitioner's evidence was not available, consequently, the hearing of this petition was put off till 4-6-2009, on which date certain witnesses summoned by the petitioner were available, however, learned counsel for respondent No.1 raised an objection against the recording of the statements of the said witnesses on account of failure of the petitioner to submit the list of witnesses, along with the election petition, as envisaged in the Notification dated 16-3-2005 issued by Election Commission of Pakistan. Consequently, hearing of this petition was put off for hearing the arguments of both the parties on the said point.\n  2. Learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the petitioner had failed to furnish the list of witnesses along with their affidavits while filing the Election Petition, however, just after framing the issues by this Tribunal the list of witnesses. along with the gist of their evidence was duly submitted in the office on 28-4-2009 and after receiving the said list and receipt of the required expenditures for\nsummoning the official witnesses the office had issued summons to the said witnesses, therefore, the objection raised by respondent No.1 is not sustainable in law. He adds that provisions of C.P.C. are fully applicable during the trial of election petitions; that under Order XVI, rule 1, C.P.C., once the issues are settled the petitioner can furnish a list of the witnesses for calling, either to give evidence or to produce documents; that the petitioner has furnished the list of witnesses in the light of the said provisions of the C.P.C., therefore, the objection raised by learned counsel for respondent No.1 is misconceived; that the provisions as contained in the Notification dated 16-3-1985 issued by Election Commission of Pakistan are not mandatory in nature, therefore, the election petition cannot be dismissed for the non-compliance of the said provisions; that the said Notification is a subordinate legislation, therefore, will not control the powers of the Tribunal, as Civil Court, conferred on it in terms of section 64 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976; that after entertaining the election petition filed by the petitioner his failure to submit the list of witnesses along with their affidavits has been impliedly condoned by the Election Commission of Pakistan ; that under section 63 (ibid), the election petition can only be dismissed for the non-compliance of provisions of sections 54 and 55 of the Act, whereas, there is no provision in the said Act justifying the dismissal of the election petition due to the failure of the petitioner to submit list of witnesses along with their affidavits. In support of his contentions learned counsel has placed reliance on the cases of Engineer Jameel Ahmed Malik v. Ghulam Sarwar Khan and 6 others 2004 CLC 914, Ihsanul Haq v. Dr. Saddique Hussain and another 1995 CLC 382, Rai Asghar Ali Khan v. Returning officer and others 1999 CLC 565 and Sardar Akhtar Ali v. Wasim Ahmed 1992 CLC 1437.",
      "case_judgement": "  12. Consequently, the objection raised by the learned counsel for the respondent to the said extent is upheld with an observation that the petitioner can move, an application giving the reasons justifying the production of the official witnesses and the documents, if any, intended to be produced and provide by the petitioner through the said witnesses and if such an application is filed the same would, of course, be decided after considering all the pros and cons of the matter.\n  13. Now to come up on 14-9-2009 for recording of evidence of the petitioner.\n  M.H./A-264/L Order accordingly.",
      "case_proceddings": " Conversely, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 has reiterated his objection by submitting that the provisions as contained in the afore-said Notification, which has been issued under section 62 of the Act, are mandatory in nature; that under section 62 every election petition has to be tried in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Election Commission, therefore, the provisions of C.P.C. are not applicable during the trial of election petition; that the petitioner cannot be allowed to violate the provisions of the said Notification only on the ground that the Election Commission of Pakistan had failed to raise the relevant objection at the time of entertaining the election petition. In order to share up his contentions learned counsel for respondent No.1 has placed reliance on the cases of Mir Tariq Mahmood Khan Khetran and others v. Mir Baz Muhammad Khetran and others 1992 CLC 1766, Ihrar Khattak v. Mian Muzaffar Shah and others 1991 CLC 175 and Sardar Khalid Nawaz v. Mian Manzoor Ahmed Wattoo 1987 CLC 1167.\n  4. Heard. Record perused.\n  5. Admittedly, while filing election petition the petitioner failed to submit a list of witnesses. However after framing of issues, the petitioner filed the list of witnesses along with gist of their statements in the office on 28-4-2009. There is also no denying the fact that before submitting the said application the petitioner did not seek any permission from this Tribunal for the submission of the said list.\n  6. Before proceeding further I would like to survey the relevant provisions of law, which would help rendering proper decision on this application. Chapter-VII of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 furnishes provisions for the settlement of election disputes, the election petition is filed under section 52, the procedure for presentation of the election petition has been given in section 53, whereas section 54 outlines the parties to be arrayed as respondents in the election petition. Section 55 provides a guideline to the election petitioner regarding the contents of the election petition including the prayer which can be made while submitting the election petition. Section 62 is most relevant for resolving the issue under debate. Under this provision of law every election petition shall be tried in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Election Commission. The said section was amended on 17th of March, 1985. Before the amendment subsection (1) of section 62 of the Act provided as under:\n  62. Procedure before Tribunal.--- (1) Subject to the provisions of the Act and the rules every election petition shall be tried as nearly as made may be in accordance with procedure for the trial of suit under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act .V of 1908) . \"\n  After amendment it reads as under:-\n  62. Procedure before Tribunal.--- Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules every election petition shall be tried in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Election Commission.\"\n  The powers of Tribunal have been prescribed under section 64 of the Act, according to which the Tribunal shall have the powers of a Civil Court trying a suit under the C.P.C. Section 63 lays down parameters for the dismissal of the election petition due to the failure of the compliance of certain provisions of the Act. Admittedly, under the said section failure to comply with the provisions of above-mentioned notification cannot be made a ground for the dismissed of an election petition. It is also true that the said Notification is a subordinate legislation, therefore, it does not control the powers of the Tribunal as Civil Court. Therefore, the law laid down in all the cases cited by learned counsel for the petitioner is fully applicable to the extent that the election petition cannot be dismissed by the Tribunal for failure of the compliance of the provisions of the said Notification.\n  7. Now, the question remains as to whether the petitioner can be allowed to produce the witnesses mentioned in his list of witnesses. Having said that the election petition cannot be dismissed due to the failure of the compliance of the said provisions of law, I would like to mention here that provisions of C.P.C. are not stricto sensu applicable during the trial of the election petition. It is true that under section 64 of the Act this Tribunal is armed with all the powers of a civil Court trying a civil suit under C.P.C. but as mentioned above, in the light of amended section 62 of the Act every election petition has to be decided in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Election Commission. In subsection (1) of section 62 the word \"shall\" has been used by the Legislature. The enactment of the said provision is not without any purpose, rather the purpose is that the election petitions should be decided expeditiously without being entangled in the lengthy procedure. The purpose of the filing of the affidavits of the witnesses obviously is that during the trial the consumption of time in recording the examination-in-chief of the said witnesses can be avoided. For the said purpose, even the framing of the issues is not necessary as has been held by the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Jam Mashooq Ali v. Shahnawaz Junejo 1996 SCMR 426. In the said case it was further held as under:-\n  \"The perusal of section 62, before the afore-mentioned amendment and after amendment together with the procedure prescribed by the Election Commission clearly shows that for the trial of Election Petitions the legislature intended to do away with lengthy procedure prescribed under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908).

Shamsul Islam for Defendants.\n    ORDER\n  NADEEM AZHAR SIDDIQI, J.--- This is an application under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C., praying for dismissal of the suit.\n  Brief facts of the case as stated in the plaint are that the plaintiff is a .container leasing company and one of its representatives, Mr. David Attenborough, entered into negotiations with Mr. M. Habibullah, Chairman of defendant No.1 (Mega-Feeder (Pvt.) Limited, for leasing containers. Later on, Mr. Shakeel Hyder, Senior Manager (Finance) of defendant No.1, also joined the negotiations. After finalization of the negotiations, an agreement dated 1-6-2006 was executed between the plaintiff and defendant No.1 through Mr. Shakeel Hyder. Subsequently, an amendment was made to the said agreement and the defendant No.2 was added as a guarantor for defendant No.1. Pursuant to the said lease agreement, the plaintiff allocated 4,086 20 feet standard containers and 1,288 40 feet High Cube containers to the defendant No.1. The business relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant No.1 were progressing smoothly for some time when in January, 2007 the defendant No.1 defaulted in payment of rentals. Meanwhile, the plaintiff received a letter from the lawyer of defendant No.1 wherein it was contended that there is no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1. The plaintiff sent a notice of default to the defendants Nos.1 and 2 in response to which the same lawyer, now also acting for defendant No.2, through his letter dated 11-4-2007, reiterated his earlier position and further stated that the containers of the plaintiff were \"foisted\" upon the defendant No.1. The plaintiff, realizing that no purpose will be served by waiting for 60 days period as stipulated in the agreement between the parties, filed the present suit inter alia for recovery of lease rentals as well as return of the containers.\n  The defendant No.1, through its Manager, Kamran Saeed, filed the present application under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C., seeking dismissal bf the suit on the grounds mentioned above.\n  I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone, through the record.\n  Learned counsel for the defendants submitted that defendants have no privity of contract with the plaintiff, the plaintiff has no cause of action against the defendants, and that the suit has been filed by a person not competent to file the same. He submits that no resolution/power of attorney and/or Articles and Memorandum of Association of the plaintiff was filed to show that the person presenting the plaint is competent to do so. He also submitted that the plaintiff has also filed a suit in the United States of America against the defendants on the same cause of action on 14-11-2007. He referred to the agreement between the parties (available at page 39 of the file) and sated that the agreement is by a company incorporated in Bermuda and not a company of United States and submitted ' that the plaintiff and the contracting Company are two different entities. He also referred to clause (k) of the agreement and stated that only Courts of State of Carolina, USA', have jurisdiction to decide a dispute in respect of the lease agreement.\n  On the other hand, Mr. Mansoor Shaikh, learned counsel for the plaintiff stated that the ingredients required for dismissal of a suit under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. are missing, he submits that the address of the plaintiff in the agreement is that of Bermuda and that the Notification Address, as mentioned at the last page of the agreement, is that of Bermuda. He further states that if copy of the power of attorney/resolution was filed at the time of filing of the suit the same is an irregularity and not an illegality. He relied on the cases of Ghulam Mohiuddin and another v. Noor Dad and others PLD 1988 SC (AJ&K) 42 and Ismail and another v. Mst. Razia Ahmad and others 1981 SCMR 687.\n  Before dilating upon the arguments advanced and case-law relied upon by the learned counsel for the parties, it would be beneficial if provisions of Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. are reproduced, which read as under: --\n  \"11. Rejection of plaint.--- The plaint shall be rejected in' the following cases:---\n  (a) where it does not disclose a cause of action;\n  (b) where the relief claimed is under-valued, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so;\n  (c) where the relief claimed is properly valued, but the plaint is written upon paper insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to supply the requisite stamp-paper within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so;\n  (d) where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law.\n  So far as the first ground on which plaint in a suit could be rejected under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C., i.e. non-existence of any cause of action, is concerned, it is evident from the plaint of the suit that the plaintiff has pleaded that the defendant No.1 was leased containers by the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1 defaulted in payment of the lease rentals for recovery whereof the plaintiff has filed this suit. The plaintiff also seeks recovery/possession of the containers leased out to the plaintiff. Although the defendants are denying having entered into any agreement with the plaintiff but it is to be decided through evidence whether the plaintiff entered into a binding agreement with the defendant No.1 which was guaranteed by defendant No.2, or not.\n  It is well-settled principle of law that for the purpose of deciding an application under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C., only the averments made in the plaint are to be taken into consideration and nothing else is to be considered for this purpose. In para.18 of the plaint the plaintiff has shown the cause of action that has accrued to the plaintiff. Mere denial by the defendants thereof cannot suffice. Thus, the provisions of sub-clause (a) of Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. are of no help to the defendants.\n  Admittedly, there is controversy as envisaged under clauses (b) and (c) of the said provision with regard to valuation of the relief claimed or the same being written on insufficiently stamped paper.\n  As regards sub-clause (d), once again the Court is to decide on the basis of the averments made in the plaint whether the suit is barred by any law.\n  Learned counsel for the defendants submitted that no power of attorney/resolution has been. filed by the person presenting the plaint in the suit to show that he was duly authorized by the plaintiff to file the present suit. However, subsequently, the counsel for the plaintiff produced a copy of the power of attorney executed by the plaintiff in favour of the person presenting the plaint, namely, Mr. S. Shakil Ahmed son of S. Abdul Aleem. Although objections were raised by learned counsel for the defendants to the delayed production of the copy of the said power of attorney but the law is very clear in this regard. In case a suit or any other proceeding is filed by a person on behalf of a company without having been duly authorized to do so by the company prior to filing of the suit or the proceedings, as the case may be, the same shall be without lawful authority and liable to be dismissed as such. However, where a suit has been filed by a duly authorized person but such authority has not been produced at the time of filing of the suit, the same cannot be said to be filed by an incompetent person. This at best can be termed as an irregularity which is curable and not as an illegality. In the verification clause of the plaint, the deponent clearly states that \"L S. Shakil Ahmad son of S. Abdul Aleem, the duly constituted attorney of the plaintiffs Company\"\" and subsequently, copy of such power of attorney was produced by counsel for the plaintiff in Court. In view of the provisions of Article 95 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, a power of attorney executed. before and authenticated by, notary public, or any Court, Judge, Magistrate, Pakistan consul or Vice Consul, or representative of the Federal Government, is to be presumed to have been so executed and authenticated.\n  Once the initial burden is discharged by the plaintiff, it is for the defendants to rebut the same by evidence.\n  This exercise can only be undertaken when the evidence of the parties is recorded.\n  The other ground urged in support of the listed application, that another suit on the same cause of action and documents has been filed by the plaintiff in the United States of America, has also no nexus with the provisions of Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C.\n  Needless to state that I am not touching the merits of the case as it would prejudice the case of either of the parties hereto. Suffice it to say that none of the provisions of order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. are applicable.\n  In view of the above, the listed application under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. is dismissed. Office to fix the case of appropriate purpose.\n  H.B.T./T-17/K Application dismissed.",

      "case_facts": "Brief facts of the case as stated in the plaint are that the plaintiff is a .container leasing company and one of its representatives, Mr. David Attenborough, entered into negotiations with Mr. M. Habibullah, Chairman of defendant No.1 (Mega-Feeder (Pvt.) Limited, for leasing containers. Later on, Mr. Shakeel Hyder, Senior Manager (Finance) of defendant No.1, also joined the negotiations. After finalization of the negotiations, an agreement dated 1-6-2006 was executed between the plaintiff and defendant No.1 through Mr. Shakeel Hyder. Subsequently, an amendment was made to the said agreement and the defendant No.2 was added as a guarantor for defendant No.1. Pursuant to the said lease agreement, the plaintiff allocated 4,086 20 feet standard containers and 1,288 40 feet High Cube containers to the defendant No.1. The business relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant No.1 were progressing smoothly for some time when in January, 2007 the defendant No.1 defaulted in payment of rentals. Meanwhile, the plaintiff received a letter from the lawyer of defendant No.1 wherein it was contended that there is no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1. The plaintiff sent a notice of default to the defendants Nos.1 and 2 in response to which the same lawyer, now also acting for defendant No.2, through his letter dated 11-4-2007, reiterated his earlier position and further stated that the containers of the plaintiff were \"foisted\" upon the defendant No.1. The plaintiff, realizing that no purpose will be served by waiting for 60 days period as stipulated in the agreement between the parties, filed the present suit inter alia for recovery of lease rentals as well as return of the containers.",
      "case_judgement": "  The other ground urged in support of the listed application, that another suit on the same cause of action and documents has been filed by the plaintiff in the United States of America, has also no nexus with the provisions of Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C.\n  Needless to state that I am not touching the merits of the case as it would prejudice the case of either of the parties hereto. Suffice it to say that none of the provisions of order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. are applicable.\n  In view of the above, the listed application under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. is dismissed. Office to fix the case of appropriate purpose.\n  H.B.T./T-17/K Application dismissed.",
      "case_proceddings": "The defendant No.1, through its Manager, Kamran Saeed, filed the present application under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C., seeking dismissal bf the suit on the grounds mentioned above.\n  I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone, through the record.\n  Learned counsel for the defendants submitted that defendants have no privity of contract with the plaintiff, the plaintiff has no cause of action against the defendants, and that the suit has been filed by a person not competent to file the same. He submits that no resolution/power of attorney and/or Articles and Memorandum of Association of the plaintiff was filed to show that the person presenting the plaint is competent to do so. He also submitted that the plaintiff has also filed a suit in the United States of America against the defendants on the same cause of action on 14-11-2007. He referred to the agreement between the parties (available at page 39 of the file) and sated that the agreement is by a company incorporated in Bermuda and not a company of United States and submitted ' that the plaintiff and the contracting Company are two different entities. He also referred to clause (k) of the agreement and stated that only Courts of State of Carolina, USA', have jurisdiction to decide a dispute in respect of the lease agreement.\n  On the other hand, Mr. Mansoor Shaikh, learned counsel for the plaintiff stated that the ingredients required for dismissal of a suit under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. are missing, he submits that the address of the plaintiff in the agreement is that of Bermuda and that the Notification Address, as mentioned at the last page of the agreement, is that of Bermuda. He further states that if copy of the power of attorney/resolution was filed at the time of filing of the suit the same is an irregularity and not an illegality. He relied on the cases of Ghulam Mohiuddin and another v. Noor Dad and others PLD 1988 SC (AJ&K) 42 and Ismail and another v. Mst. Razia Ahmad and others 1981 SCMR 687.\n  Before dilating upon the arguments advanced and case-law relied upon by the learned counsel for the parties, it would be beneficial if provisions of Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. are reproduced, which read as under: --\n  \"11. Rejection of plaint.--- The plaint shall be rejected in' the following cases:---\n  (a) where it does not disclose a cause of action;\n  (b) where the relief claimed is under-valued, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so;\n  (c) where the relief claimed is properly valued, but the plaint is written upon paper insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to supply the requisite stamp-paper within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so;\n  (d) where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law.\n  So far as the first ground on which plaint in a suit could be rejected under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C., i.e. non-existence of any cause of action, is concerned, it is evident from the plaint of the suit that the plaintiff has pleaded that the defendant No.1 was leased containers by the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1 defaulted in payment of the lease rentals for recovery whereof the plaintiff has filed this suit. The plaintiff also seeks recovery/possession of the containers leased out to the plaintiff. Although the defendants are denying having entered into any agreement with the plaintiff but it is to be decided through evidence whether the plaintiff entered into a binding agreement with the defendant No.1 which was guaranteed by defendant No.2, or not.\n  It is well-settled principle of law that for the purpose of deciding an application under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C., only the averments made in the plaint are to be taken into consideration and nothing else is to be considered for this purpose. In para.18 of the plaint the plaintiff has shown the cause of action that has accrued to the plaintiff. Mere denial by the defendants thereof cannot suffice. Thus, the provisions of sub-clause (a) of Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. are of no help to the defendants.\n  Admittedly, there is controversy as envisaged under clauses (b) and (c) of the said provision with regard to valuation of the relief claimed or the same being written on insufficiently stamped paper.\n  As regards sub-clause (d), once again the Court is to decide on the basis of the averments made in the plaint whether the suit is barred by any law.\n  Learned counsel for the defendants submitted that no power of attorney/resolution has been. filed by the person presenting the plaint in the suit to show that he was duly authorized by the plaintiff to file the present suit. However, subsequently, the counsel for the plaintiff produced a copy of the power of attorney executed by the plaintiff in favour of the person presenting the plaint, namely, Mr. S. Shakil Ahmed son of S. Abdul Aleem. Although objections were raised by learned counsel for the defendants to the delayed production of the copy of the said power of attorney but the law is very clear in this regard. In case a suit or any other proceeding is filed by a person on behalf of a company without having been duly authorized to do so by the company prior to filing of the suit or the proceedings, as the case may be, the same shall be without lawful authority and liable to be dismissed as such. However, where a suit has been filed by a duly authorized person but such authority has not been produced at the time of filing of the suit, the same cannot be said to be filed by an incompetent person. This at best can be termed as an irregularity which is curable and not as an illegality. In the verification clause of the plaint, the deponent clearly states that \"L S. Shakil Ahmad son of S. Abdul Aleem, the duly constituted attorney of the plaintiffs Company\"\" and subsequently, copy of such power of attorney was produced by counsel for the plaintiff in Court. In view of the provisions of Article 95 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, a power of attorney executed. before and authenticated by, notary public, or any Court, Judge, Magistrate, Pakistan consul or Vice Consul, or representative of the Federal Government, is to be presumed to have been so executed and authenticated.\n  Once the initial burden is discharged by the plaintiff, it is for the defendants to rebut the same by evidence.\n  This exercise can only be undertaken when the evidence of the parties is recorded.",

Facts in brief are that the land fully described in the plaint was owned by three brothers Manzoor Ahmad, Rafique Ahmad and Saeed Ahmad sons of Murad. Manzoor Ahmad died issueless and the share of the property fell on the remaining two brothers. Mutation No.365 was sanctioned on 30-5-199-1. These two brothers, it is stated, sold out the suit-land to the petitioners for an amount of Rs.3,23,000 through oral Mutation No.369 dated 31-7-1991 and possession thereof was also delivered: In the year, 1992, respondents NoS.2 to 4 with the similar name and parentage came out with the plea that they, in fact, are owners of the suit property and some body impersonating them on their behalf, sold out the property to the petitioner and in the Revenue Record the caste Joota was entered instead of Joiya. It was stated that Muhammad Rafique was still alive and the whole thing was the result of fraud. Petitioners to settle the title instituted the suit in the nature of declaration-cum-Permanent Injunction on 23-10-1992. The suit is shown to have been contested but later on the ex parte decree was passed. It is stated that the learned District Judge made entrustment of the suit vide order dated 18-12-1995 directing the parties to enter appearance before the Civil Judge, Layyah but they consciously absented themselves. The suit was decreed on 20-12-1995 in favour of the petitioners.\n  3. There was yet another round of litigation. The respondents moved an application before the District Collector for cancellation of Mutations Nos.365 and 369 on the basis of fraud. The District Collector vide his order dated 17-10-1994, accepted the application of respondents Nos.2 and 3 and cancelled the mutations accordingly. Petitioners filed a revision before the Commissioner, D.G. Khan who accepted the revision on 21-12-1994 by having held that this was an intricate question of fact and the matter squarely falls within the jurisdiction of civil Court. Against the said order of the Commissioner, the revision application was instituted by the respondents (ROR No.1346 of 1995) which was accepted on 19-4-2000. Petitioners again instituted suit in the nature of declaration before the Civil Court at Layyah claiming that the order dated 19-4-2000 passed by the Member (Judicial) Board of Revenue was illegal and thus inoperative qua their rights. During the pendency of the suit, respondents Nos.2 to 4, it appears, made an application under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. on 27-10-2000 seeking rejection of plaint. After getting reply of the said miscellaneous application, the learned trial Judge vide order and decree dated 28-4-2003 rejected the plaint. Against the said order and decree, appeal was preferred by the petitioners which failed before the learned District Judge on 5-11-2003.\n  4. Learned counsel for the petitioners states that both the Courts below have fallen in error and committed serious illegalities and irregularities in reaching at the conclusion that jurisdiction of the Civil Court is barred. Further argued that the Member Board of Revenue had decided the matter finally on 19-4-2000 and at the time when initially the suit was decreed, the order of the Member Board of Revenue was not in the field. It being a case of fresh cause of action the subsequent suit was competent.\n  5. Learned counsel for the respondents states under section 172 of the West Pakistan Land Revenue Act, the jurisdiction is not available with the Civil Court to entertain the dispute.\n  6. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with their able assistance.\n  7. Under Rule 11 of Order VII, C.P.C., the plaint can only be rejected when it .does not disclose cause of action or where the relief claimed is under valued and the suitor on being required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court failed to do so or where the relief claimed is properly valued but the plaint is insufficiently stamped and the suit from the statement in the plaint appears to be barred by any law. For determination whether the suit is barred by law, the averments contained in the plaint can only be looked into and the decision in any case on the assertion of the defendants based on a material foreign to the record cannot be made. It is a bounden duty of the Court to see whether from the statement made in the plaint there was another cause of action available and whether the suit is barred by law or not. Reference may be made to Cotenca Inspection SA and another v. Messrs Ismail and Co. and, 6 others 2001 CLC 899 and Sajid Saeed v. Inam-ul-Haq 2007 MLD 1622. The jurisdiction of the Civil Court to rectify the wrong done or the entries made in the Revenue Record cannot be excluded merely by operation of section 172 of the West Pakistan Land Revenue Act. The jurisdiction is only barred in respect of those matters or functions which have been assigned to the Revenue Court. Every presumption should invariably be made in favour of the jurisdiction of the Court and all laws touching upon the usual jurisdiction of the case should be construed strictly. Ouster of jurisdiction of the Civil Court not to be interfered until and unless word used in the relevant Statute makes it clear that the intention was to take away the jurisdiction in specific terms. In the case in hand, the question arose before the Revenue Court was with regard to the genuineness of the transaction or otherwise and the claim of the respondents was not based on merely correction of entries in the Revenue Record. In such like cases the jurisdiction is readily available with the Civil Court and with the none else. Reference may be made to Khawaja Muhammad Akbar and 5 others v. Khawaja Fateh Muhammad and 15 others 1993 MLD 76, Rasta Mal Khan and others v. Nabi Sarwar Khan and others 1996 SCMR 78, Abdur Rehman and others v. Abdul Qadir and others 1998 CLC 401, Safdar and 5 others v. Rashid Ahmad and 12 others 1994 SCMR 1454 and Muhammad Yousaf and 3 others v. Khan Bahadur through Legal Heirs 1992 SCMR 2334. The Revenue Officers are bound to give affect to the decree passed by the Civil Court in the Revenue Record and ultimate jurisdiction remains with the Civil Court to settle the issue. In the case in hand, the claim of the respondents hinges on the validity of the mutation of sale and not something in the nature of correction of the record. Petitioner is holding an ex parte decree dated 20-12-1995 of the Civil Court. At the time when the Additional Commissioner Dera Ghazi Khan passed the order, the civil suit was pending. This fact has been noted in paragraph No.4 of the order of the Additional Commissioner. The learned counsel for the respondents states that he had no knowledge of the pendency of civil suit. When the order was passed by the Commissioner, D.G. Khan Division, even if it is assumed that earlier he had no: notice of the pendency of the civil suit, it came in the knowledge of the respondents when Commissioner, D.G. Khan Division passed an order on revision brought by the petitioners. In any case ex parte decree had been passed in favour of the petitioners and the affect of that decree is yet to be seen by the Civil Court. The Member Board of Revenue passed the order on 14-4-2000, which in any case gave a fresh cause of action to the suitor to maintain a lis before the Civil Court.\n  8. The reasons which weighed with the learned trial Judge was that the petitioners were holding an ex parte decree in their favour and there is no justification in law to file another suit on the same cause of action. Secondly the Revenue Record has been corrected by the revenue authorities and the decision of the Collector was maintained by the Board of Revenue; where after the jurisdiction is not available with the Civil Court. These grounds on the basis of which the petitioners have been non-suited are not available and for these two reasons the plaint could not be rejected under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. That fact that the petitioners are holding a Civil Court decree in their hand, it cannot be make a relevant ground to non-suit them. Adverse attack has been made against the rights of the petitioners finally on 19-4-2000. The moment order has been passed by the Member Board of Revenue, the suit was competent. Whether the plaint is hit by the principle of Res Judicata or not, can only be determined after holding the trial and in no other manner. Both the Courts below have committed illegalities and irregularities ad infinitum in reaching at the impugned conclusion.\n  9. For whatever it has been stated above, I have come to the conclusion that the Courts below have acted illegally and with material irregularities in passing the impugned decisions to non-suit the petitioners. Both the impugned decrees are not sustainable at law. In nutshell the revision petition is accepted. The order and decree of the trial Court dated 28-4-2003 and the judgment and decree of the learned District Judge dated 5-11-2003 are set aside. The case will go back before the learned District Judge, Layyah who shall entrust the same to any of the Civil Judge or the Senior Civil Judge working under his command. There shall however be no order as to costs.\n  M.H./A-277/A/L Case remanded.",

The jurisdiction is only barred in respect of those matters or functions which have been assigned to the Revenue Court. Every presumption should invariably be made in favour of the jurisdiction of the Court and all laws touching upon the usual jurisdiction of the case should be construed strictly. Ouster of jurisdiction of the Civil Court not to be interfered until and unless word used in the relevant Statute makes it clear that the intention was to take away the jurisdiction in specific terms. In the case in hand, the question arose before the Revenue Court was with regard to the genuineness of the transaction or otherwise and the claim of the respondents was not based on merely correction of entries in the Revenue Record. In such like cases the jurisdiction is readily available with the Civil Court and with the none else. Reference may be made to Khawaja Muhammad Akbar and 5 others v. Khawaja Fateh Muhammad and 15 others 1993 MLD 76, Rasta Mal Khan and others v. Nabi Sarwar Khan and others 1996 SCMR 78, Abdur Rehman and others v. Abdul Qadir and others 1998 CLC 401, Safdar and 5 others v. Rashid Ahmad and 12 others 1994 SCMR 1454 and Muhammad Yousaf and 3 others v. Khan Bahadur through Legal Heirs 1992 SCMR 2334. The Revenue Officers are bound to give affect to the decree passed by the Civil Court in the Revenue Record and ultimate jurisdiction remains with the Civil Court to settle the issue. In the case in hand, the claim of the respondents hinges on the validity of the mutation of sale and not something in the nature of correction of the record. Petitioner is holding an ex parte decree dated 20-12-1995 of the Civil Court. At the time when the Additional Commissioner Dera Ghazi Khan passed the order, the civil suit was pending. This fact has been noted in paragraph No.4 of the order of the Additional Commissioner. The learned counsel for the respondents states that he had no knowledge of the pendency of civil suit. When the order was passed by the Commissioner, D.G. Khan Division, even if it is assumed that earlier he had no: notice of the pendency of the civil suit, it came in the knowledge of the respondents when Commissioner, D.G. Khan Division passed an order on revision brought by the petitioners. In any case ex parte decree had been passed in favour of the petitioners and the affect of that decree is yet to be seen by the Civil Court. The Member Board of Revenue passed the order on 14-4-2000, which in any case gave a fresh cause of action to the suitor to maintain a lis before the Civil Court.\n  8. The reasons which weighed with the learned trial Judge was that the petitioners were holding an ex parte decree in their favour and there is no justification in law to file another suit on the same cause of action. Secondly the Revenue Record has been corrected by the revenue authorities and the decision of the Collector was maintained by the Board of Revenue; where after the jurisdiction is not available with the Civil Court. These grounds on the basis of which the petitioners have been non-suited are not available and for these two reasons the plaint could not be rejected under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. That fact that the petitioners are holding a Civil Court decree in their hand, it cannot be make a relevant ground to non-suit them. Adverse attack has been made against the rights of the petitioners finally on 19-4-2000. The moment order has been passed by the Member Board of Revenue, the suit was competent. Whether the plaint is hit by the principle of Res Judicata or not, can only be determined after holding the trial and in no other manner. Both the Courts below have committed illegalities and irregularities ad infinitum in reaching at the impugned conclusion.",

In response the learned Advocate-General argued that since the petitioners have failed to pay back the loans due on them in favour of various financial institutions as such. they are disqualified to contest the elections under the rule 37 of the order as such the impugned orders lacking no jurisdiction and are according to law and the writ petitions are not maintainable.\n  We, keeping in view the points raised by the learned counsel and the learned Advocate-General, visited the order to examine and ascertain whether the petitioners are disqualified under the provisions of the order to contest the elections as the order has been recently introduced by the Federal Government which is basic legal document and can be deemed as having force of constitution for Gilgit-Baltistan, whereby not only the Assembly has been created but the fundamental rights of citizens of Gilgit-Baltistan have also been prescribed and qualifications or disqualification of a candidate contesting the elections to the Assembly have been stated therein.\n  The learned Advocate-General emphasized on provision 37(2)(b) of the Order whereby in his opinion, the petitioners are disqualified to contest the elections as they have failed to pay the dues to various financial Institutions, hence the provision is reproduced hereunder:---\n  \"37(2)(b) \"he is an undischarged insolvent unless a period of ten years has elapsed since his being adjudged as insolvent.\"\n  In this provision two words (a) \"undischarged insolvent\" and \"adjudged\" are required to be defined and interpreted:---\n  \"Insolvent\" A debtor is said to be insolvent when he cannot pay his debts as they become due, out of his own moneys.

Present respondents Nos.4 and 5 are arrayed in the ejectment application also and are claimed to be persons to whom possession had been handed over by the tenant. Property in question is 42 and 42-A, at top floor, Masood Chamber Building, on Plot No.W-O-6/23, Wadhomal Quarters, M.A. Jinnah Road, Karachi. Ejectment application was filed on the ground of default and parting with possession. Learned Rent Controller vide order, dated 6-5-2000 allowed ejectment application on the ground of parting with possession. However, ground of default was dismissed. Appeal was filed against order of Rent Controller by respondent No.3. Appeal was allowed vide order dated 9-3-2004. On 6-4-2009 it was noticed that respondents Nos.4 and 5 have been served through publication in daily Nawa-e-Waqt dated 1-2-2009 and 'service was held good. Respondent No.3 was present in person.\n  2. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that respondent No.3 handed over possession to the respondents Nos.4 and 5 and converted tenement into a kind of-guesthouse. Notice of the rent case was received by respondent No.5. Respondent No.3 had sublet premises and handed over possession of premises to respondents Nos.4 and 5 without permission of landlord. Respondent No.3 was realizing rent from respondents Nos.4 and 5. Respondent No.5 stated that he is living in Punjab Club but did not produce any evidence that he was living there.\n  In presence of specific allegation that respondent No.5 was living in Punjab Club it was his responsibility to establish his position before Rent Controller and thereafter he, has to produce documentary proof thereof of inducting any person without consent of landlord and of parting with possession. Learned counsel for petitioner in support of his submission relied upon M.D. Tahir, Advocate v. Lahore High Court through Registrar 1994 SCMR 1507, Tariq Hussain Hashmi and others v. Master Ali Ammar and others 2001 MLD 21, Minochar N. Kharas represented by Legal Heirs v. Ali Hassan Manghi and 6 others 1986 CLC 1378, Messrs Premier Mercantile Service and another v. S.M. Younus and 2 others PLD 1982 SC 79 and Haji Muhammad Khan and 2 others v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan and 2 others 1992 SCMR 2439.\n  3. Learned counsel for respondent No.3 referred to order of the trial Court where trial Court had observed that burden of proof whether the respondent No.3 had sublet premises in question to respondent No.5 was on the respondent No.3. He submitted that burden to prove is always on the person who makes assertion and since it was assertion of the landlord that tenant had sublet premises/parted with possession, burden to prove such fact was on the landlord. Order of Rent Controller based on surmises and conjectures and order of the Appellate Court is in consonance with evidence produced. Learned counsel relied upon Abdul Salam v. Mrs. Tahir Zaidi 1988 MLD 1854 and Matloob v. Syed Abdul Qayyum 1988 MLD 2150.\n  4. I have considered submissions made by the learned counsel and perused the material on record as well case-law cited by the learned counsel.\n  5. Point at issue is only whether respondent No.3 parted with possession of demised premises by inducting respondents Nos.4 and 5 therein. It is case of landlord that respondent No.5 had sublet premises in question and parted with possession of the same by inducting respondents Nos.4 and 5 in the tenement. Case of respondent No.3 is that respondents Nos.4 and 5 are his relatives. Respondent No.5 appeared as a witness and specifically stated that he lives in Punjab Club. Respondent No.5 in his cross-examination stated as under:---\n  \"I live in Punjabi Club, Bohri Road. It is correct that when I made my I.D. Card, Passport Licence I was living in Punjabi Club. I live on rent in Punjabi Club. I have not filed my document showing that I am still living in Punjabi Club. It is correct that I have taken the notice from bailiff at the premises in question because on that day I have gone there to see my uncle (Mamu). It is correct that I did not told the bailiff that I do not live there neither he asked me my mamo lives in demise premises with his nephews and four others people. I some time comes to visit my mamo after two days three days or some times daily. It is incorrect to say that my belonging are also in demise premises nor my cot is there. It is incorrect that I live in demise premises I have never seen Masood.\"\n  6. Respondent No.3 in his cross-examination stated as under:---\n  \"... In my absence my nephew was living at this place. ... It is incorrect that Advocate has asked me not to allow people at upstairs. My nephew, my grandson and my son lives with me in present building they live with me but they are not tenants. Their names are Mukamal Khan, Sher Khan, Rehman Din and Said Bag Khan. It is incorrect besides these people other people sleep here. It is correct that I did not file any money order receipt. Opponent No.3 is my nephew and does not live with me. ... It is correct that my nephew opponent No.2 signed the Court notice and received it.\"\n  7. Petitioner/landlord besides establishing that notice of ejectment application was received on behalf of respondent No.3, by respondent No.5 at demised premises in his cross-examination as under:---\n  \".... It is correct in my second notice dated 29 August, 1998 A/5 I have not mentioned about the sub-letting. After the postal receipt that opponent has left his village I tried to contact him but could not contact as he has left after sub-letting the premises, then I came to know about it after my inquiry and came to know from building people. Bank people and Chaiwalas. I visited myself personally to the premises. I have written that I made the inquiry in my A/E though I have not used the word inquiry, nor has mentioned that Chaiwala and Bankwala confirmed this fact. I have seen opponents Nos.2 and 3 once. I came to know in August, 1988 ' after I gave notice to opponent on that opponent no one has subletted the premises; when I personally visited the premises two three persons were sitting there who told me that Feroz Khan no more lives here. I do not know the name of those persons. Service upon Feroz Khan has been made on the same address. It is incorrect that I have based my application only upon the information given to me by Gul Hassan. It is incorrect that Feroz Khan still lives in demised premises and is Chowkidar of building; opponents Nos.2 and 3 live in case premises non-collecting water charges from my, tenement. It is in correct that I did not demand the water charges from Feroz Khan through notice .It is incorrect that opponent No.2 is relative of Feroz Khan.\n  8. Learned trial Court observed that burden of proving of issue that respondent No.1 has parted with possession is on the opponents. Its findings are in the following words:-\n  \"The burden to prove this issue lies upon the opponents. From the perusal of record it reveals that the notice of Court was received by the opponent No.3 himself on the premises in question, but the Opponent No.3 took the pleas that he is nephew of opponent No.1 and is residing in Punjabi Club, Bhori Road, Karachi. During the cross-examination opponent No.1 stated that it is correct that an F.I.R. has been lodged against me for that in Yousuf Naz, Advocate's 'office, it is not only against me but also against Chai Wala and others. From the perusal of cross-examination of opponent No.3 it is further revealed that opponent No.3 during the cross-examination stated that when I make my I.D. Card, Passport Licence, I was living in Punjab Club, I have not filed any document showing that I am still living in Punjaby Club. He further admitted that I have taken the notice from Bailiff at the premises in question. It is correct that I did not told the bailiff that I do not live here. I am of the opinion that in the light of above admissions there is sufficient material to prove that the opponent No.1 subletted the premises to opponent No.3, firstly the opponent 3 received the notice of this Court on the premises in question from the Bailiff, which is also admitted by the Opponent No.3 during the cross-examination and secondly the Opponent No.3 admittedly failed to prove that he is still living at Punjabi Club, Bhori Road, Karachi and thirdly one F.I.R. was lodged by Yousuf Naz, Advocate for theft against the Opponent No.2 Chai Wall and others. In the light of above sufficient material is available to prove sub-letting, therefore, answer of this issue is in affirmative.\"\n  9. Learned Appellate Court has dealt with burden of proof and held that it was upon landlord and has also held that mere visiting by relatives does not constitute parting of possession. As far as question of burden of proof is concerned, once evidence of both sides is recorded, the question of burden of proof loses its shine. It is duty of the Court to evaluate the evidence of two sides and thereafter to decide question on the basis of preponderance of evidence. On that touchstone learned Rent Controller observed that respondent No.5 received notice of rent case on behalf of respondent No.3 at the said premises.\n  10. Respondent No.5 has been living, it claimed by him, in Punjab Colony since 1974. For that time he was not as able to produce any document to establish that he was living in Punjabi Club. Nor did he produce documents of property nor any rent agreement of the same.\n  Respondent No.3 admitted that his nephew, grandson and his son live with him in the building but stated that they are not his tenants. He stated that respondent No.5 is his nephew and he is living in Punjabi Club. As against this, the only piece of evidence relied upon by tenant is his oral assertions. Question is where does preponderance evidence is lie or rather should lead the Court.\n  11. Learned counsel for petitioner first of all relied on Tariq Hussain Hashmi's case. In this case record revealed that power of attorney had been given by the appellant in favour of his father-in-law when business in the case premises with tenant had not yet started. Premises was let out to appellant in July, 1988 and therefore, it was held that evidence of attorney of appellant had no force. Person to whom it was allegedly sub-let was not examined. In such circumstances, it was held that sub-letting had been successfully proved. It was also held that handing over possession by opponent to some other person without consent of landlord is sufficient to hold that tenant had violated terms and conditions of tenancy agreement hence he is liable for eviction. In the present case even person to whom he is alleged to have sublet the premises has been examined. In Haji Muhammad Khan's case Maxim \"Secundum allegata et probata\" was referred and it was held that plaintiffs having relied upon documents in question were 'required to satisfy the Court about correctness and genuineness of the same. In Muhammad Subhan's \"case premises was originally let out to a sole proprietor and it was held that original tenant by creating another partnership in the premises shall be deemed to have handed over its possession to partner without consent of landlord and would commit violation of section 15(2)(iii)(a) of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979. This case is clearly not applicable to the facts of present case. Here no partnership is alleged. Contention of tenant is that persons living with him are his relatives and .are not tenants. Therefore, this case is quite distinguishable. In S.M. Younus's case tenant was registered partnership firm. Firm converted itself into a private limited company. It was held that since company is distinct and separate entity such incorporation constitutes subletting/parting with possession. Again it is quite distinguishable. In Minochar N. Kharas's case respondent filed, ejectment application on the ground, inter alia, of subletting. All the applicants claiming to be sub-lessees of tenant were joined as party. Ejectment application was allowed. In written statement sub-letting was admitted but it was submitted that they were inducted. into the property by previous owner and had continued as sub-lessees for a long time. Subletting was held to have been established.\n  12. On the other hand learned counsel for respondent No.3 relied upon Abdul Salam's case. It was held in that case that residing of relative with him for some time would not constitute subletting. Relevant - part of observation follows as under:--\n  \".... The respondent in one of her affidavit filed before the Rent Controller in support of her application under Order V, rule 20, C.P.C. had herself admitted that on the relevant date the appellant was in possession of the premises.. This evidence was not accepted by the Rent Controller on the ground that an affidavit in support of the application under Order V, rule 20 is not a, substantive piece of evidence. I am not able to understand the reasoning given by the Rent Controller for discarding the affidavit of the respondent which was filed in the proceedings before him and which the respondent had admitted in the cross-examination as correct. The evidence on record at best shows that some of the relations of the appellant temporarily resided with him in the disputed premises which could not establish a case of complete handing over of the premises by the appellant to some other person or subletting of the premises by the appellant to some other person. I accordingly reverse the finding of the Rent Controller on the issue of subletting and hold that the respondent failed to establish subletting of the premises by the appellant to some other person.\"\n  13. In Matloob's case landlord alleged that tenant had transferred the possession of premises in dispute to some other person without consent and permission of landlord and tenant on the other hand categorically denied. Its burden of proof of parting with possession was held to be on landlord. However, landlord in this case had not stated name of alleged sub-lessees whom premises was alleged to have been given by tenant.\n  14. In the present case names of alleged sub-lessees are specifically stated. One of the alleged sub-lessees is claimed by tenant to be his nephew who claimed that he had been living in Punjabi Club and tenant stated that he has been living there since 1974. This ejectment application was filed in 1998. If nephew had been living in Punjabi Club for 24 years surely he must have been in possession of some documents to establish as to whether and in what capacity he had been living there; whether he was owner or tenant. No such document has been produced by him.\n  15. When notice of this ejectment application was served it was received by respondent No.5 on behalf of respondent No.3. But might argue that he was just visiting there but would an occasional visitor receive a Court notice on behalf of resident of a place; impossible but highly probable. Preponderance of evidence indicates that petitioner has successfully proved his case. I, therefore, accept this petition in limine, set aside the impugned order and direct the respondents Nos.3 to 5 to hand over the vacant peaceful possession of tenement to petitioner within 90 days of passing of this judgment.\n  H.B.T./M-203/K Petition accepted.",

      "case_proceddings": "Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that respondent No.3 handed over possession to the respondents Nos.4 and 5 and converted tenement into a kind of-guesthouse. Notice of the rent case was received by respondent No.5. Respondent No.3 had sublet premises and handed over possession of premises to respondents Nos.4 and 5 without permission of landlord. Respondent No.3 was realizing rent from respondents Nos.4 and 5. Respondent No.5 stated that he is living in Punjab Club but did not produce any evidence that he was living there.\n  In presence of specific allegation that respondent No.5 was living in Punjab Club it was his responsibility to establish his position before Rent Controller and thereafter he, has to produce documentary proof thereof of inducting any person without consent of landlord and of parting with possession. Learned counsel for petitioner in support of his submission relied upon M.D. Tahir, Advocate v. Lahore High Court through Registrar 1994 SCMR 1507, Tariq Hussain Hashmi and others v. Master Ali Ammar and others 2001 MLD 21, Minochar N. Kharas represented by Legal Heirs v. Ali Hassan Manghi and 6 others 1986 CLC 1378, Messrs Premier Mercantile Service and another v. S.M. Younus and 2 others PLD 1982 SC 79 and Haji Muhammad Khan and 2 others v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan and 2 others 1992 SCMR 2439.\n  3. Learned counsel for respondent No.3 referred to order of the trial Court where trial Court had observed that burden of proof whether the respondent No.3 had sublet premises in question to respondent No.5 was on the respondent No.3. He submitted that burden to prove is always on the person who makes assertion and since it was assertion of the landlord that tenant had sublet premises/parted with possession, burden to prove such fact was on the landlord. Order of Rent Controller based on surmises and conjectures and order of the Appellate Court is in consonance with evidence produced. Learned counsel relied upon Abdul Salam v. Mrs. Tahir Zaidi 1988 MLD 1854 and Matloob v. Syed Abdul Qayyum 1988 MLD 2150.\n  4. I have considered submissions made by the learned counsel and perused the material on record as well case-law cited by the learned counsel.\n  5. Point at issue is only whether respondent No.3 parted with possession of demised premises by inducting respondents Nos.4 and 5 therein. It is case of landlord that respondent No.5 had sublet premises in question and parted with possession of the same by inducting respondents Nos.4 and 5 in the tenement. Case of respondent No.3 is that respondents Nos.4 and 5 are his relatives. Respondent No.5 appeared as a witness and specifically stated that he lives in Punjab Club. Respondent No.5 in his cross-examination stated as under:---\n  \"I live in Punjabi Club, Bohri Road. It is correct that when I made my I.D. Card, Passport Licence I was living in Punjabi Club. I live on rent in Punjabi Club. I have not filed my document showing that I am still living in Punjabi Club. It is correct that I have taken the notice from bailiff at the premises in question because on that day I have gone there to see my uncle (Mamu). It is correct that I did not told the bailiff that I do not live there neither he asked me my mamo lives in demise premises with his nephews and four others people. I some time comes to visit my mamo after two days three days or some times daily. It is incorrect to say that my belonging are also in demise premises nor my cot is there. It is incorrect that I live in demise premises I have never seen Masood.\"\n  6. Respondent No.3 in his cross-examination stated as under:---\n  \"... In my absence my nephew was living at this place. ... It is incorrect that Advocate has asked me not to allow people at upstairs. My nephew, my grandson and my son lives with me in present building they live with me but they are not tenants. Their names are Mukamal Khan, Sher Khan, Rehman Din and Said Bag Khan. It is incorrect besides these people other people sleep here. It is correct that I did not file any money order receipt. Opponent No.3 is my nephew and does not live with me. ... It is correct that my nephew opponent No.2 signed the Court notice and received it.\"\n  7. Petitioner/landlord besides establishing that notice of ejectment application was received on behalf of respondent No.3, by respondent No.5 at demised premises in his cross-examination as under:---\n  \".... It is correct in my second notice dated 29 August, 1998 A/5 I have not mentioned about the sub-letting. After the postal receipt that opponent has left his village I tried to contact him but could not contact as he has left after sub-letting the premises, then I came to know about it after my inquiry and came to know from building people. Bank people and Chaiwalas. I visited myself personally to the premises. I have written that I made the inquiry in my A/E though I have not used the word inquiry, nor has mentioned that Chaiwala and Bankwala confirmed this fact. I have seen opponents Nos.2 and 3 once. I came to know in August, 1988 ' after I gave notice to opponent on that opponent no one has subletted the premises; when I personally visited the premises two three persons were sitting there who told me that Feroz Khan no more lives here. I do not know the name of those persons. Service upon Feroz Khan has been made on the same address. It is incorrect that I have based my application only upon the information given to me by Gul Hassan. It is incorrect that Feroz Khan still lives in demised premises and is Chowkidar of building; opponents Nos.2 and 3 live in case premises non-collecting water charges from my, tenement. It is in correct that I did not demand the water charges from Feroz Khan through notice .It is incorrect that opponent No.2 is relative of Feroz Khan.\n  8. Learned trial Court observed that burden of proving of issue that respondent No.1 has parted with possession is on the opponents. Its findings are in the following words:-\n  \"The burden to prove this issue lies upon the opponents. From the perusal of record it reveals that the notice of Court was received by the opponent No.3 himself on the premises in question, but the Opponent No.3 took the pleas that he is nephew of opponent No.1 and is residing in Punjabi Club, Bhori Road, Karachi. During the cross-examination opponent No.1 stated that it is correct that an F.I.R. has been lodged against me for that in Yousuf Naz, Advocate's 'office, it is not only against me but also against Chai Wala and others. From the perusal of cross-examination of opponent No.3 it is further revealed that opponent No.3 during the cross-examination stated that when I make my I.D. Card, Passport Licence, I was living in Punjab Club, I have not filed any document showing that I am still living in Punjaby Club. He further admitted that I have taken the notice from Bailiff at the premises in question. It is correct that I did not told the bailiff that I do not live here. I am of the opinion that in the light of above admissions there is sufficient material to prove that the opponent No.1 subletted the premises to opponent No.3, firstly the opponent 3 received the notice of this Court on the premises in question from the Bailiff, which is also admitted by the Opponent No.3 during the cross-examination and secondly the Opponent No.3 admittedly failed to prove that he is still living at Punjabi Club, Bhori Road, Karachi and thirdly one F.I.R. was lodged by Yousuf Naz, Advocate for theft against the Opponent No.2 Chai Wall and others. In the light of above sufficient material is available to prove sub-letting, therefore, answer of this issue is in affirmative.\"\n  9. Learned Appellate Court has dealt with burden of proof and held that it was upon landlord and has also held that mere visiting by relatives does not constitute parting of possession. As far as question of burden of proof is concerned, once evidence of both sides is recorded, the question of burden of proof loses its shine. It is duty of the Court to evaluate the evidence of two sides and thereafter to decide question on the basis of preponderance of evidence. On that touchstone learned Rent Controller observed that respondent No.5 received notice of rent case on behalf of respondent No.3 at the said premises.\n  10. Respondent No.5 has been living, it claimed by him, in Punjab Colony since 1974. For that time he was not as able to produce any document to establish that he was living in Punjabi Club. Nor did he produce documents of property nor any rent agreement of the same.\n  Respondent No.3 admitted that his nephew, grandson and his son live with him in the building but stated that they are not his tenants. He stated that respondent No.5 is his nephew and he is living in Punjabi Club. As against this, the only piece of evidence relied upon by tenant is his oral assertions. Question is where does preponderance evidence is lie or rather should lead the Court.\n  11. Learned counsel for petitioner first of all relied on Tariq Hussain Hashmi's case. In this case record revealed that power of attorney had been given by the appellant in favour of his father-in-law when business in the case premises with tenant had not yet started. Premises was let out to appellant in July, 1988 and therefore, it was held that evidence of attorney of appellant had no force. Person to whom it was allegedly sub-let was not examined. In such circumstances, it was held that sub-letting had been successfully proved. It was also held that handing over possession by opponent to some other person without consent of landlord is sufficient to hold that tenant had violated terms and conditions of tenancy agreement hence he is liable for eviction. In the present case even person to whom he is alleged to have sublet the premises has been examined. In Haji Muhammad Khan's case Maxim \"Secundum allegata et probata\" was referred and it was held that plaintiffs having relied upon documents in question were 'required to satisfy the Court about correctness and genuineness of the same. In Muhammad Subhan's \"case premises was originally let out to a sole proprietor and it was held that original tenant by creating another partnership in the premises shall be deemed to have handed over its possession to partner without consent of landlord and would commit violation of section 15(2)(iii)(a) of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979. This case is clearly not applicable to the facts of present case. Here no partnership is alleged. Contention of tenant is that persons living with him are his relatives and .are not tenants. Therefore, this case is quite distinguishable. In S.M. Younus's case tenant was registered partnership firm. Firm converted itself into a private limited company. It was held that since company is distinct and separate entity such incorporation constitutes subletting/parting with possession. Again it is quite distinguishable. In Minochar N. Kharas's case respondent filed, ejectment application on the ground, inter alia, of subletting. All the applicants claiming to be sub-lessees of tenant were joined as party. Ejectment application was allowed. In written statement sub-letting was admitted but it was submitted that they were inducted. into the property by previous owner and had continued as sub-lessees for a long time. Subletting was held to have been established.\n  12. On the other hand learned counsel for respondent No.3 relied upon Abdul Salam's case. It was held in that case that residing of relative with him for some time would not constitute subletting. Relevant - part of observation follows as under:--\n  \".... The respondent in one of her affidavit filed before the Rent Controller in support of her application under Order V, rule 20, C.P.C. had herself admitted that on the relevant date the appellant was in possession of the premises.. This evidence was not accepted by the Rent Controller on the ground that an affidavit in support of the application under Order V, rule 20 is not a, substantive piece of evidence. I am not able to understand the reasoning given by the Rent Controller for discarding the affidavit of the respondent which was filed in the proceedings before him and which the respondent had admitted in the cross-examination as correct. The evidence on record at best shows that some of the relations of the appellant temporarily resided with him in the disputed premises which could not establish a case of complete handing over of the premises by the appellant to some other person or subletting of the premises by the appellant to some other person. I accordingly reverse the finding of the Rent Controller on the issue of subletting and hold that the respondent failed to establish subletting of the premises by the appellant to some other person.\"\n  13. In Matloob's case landlord alleged that tenant had transferred the possession of premises in dispute to some other person without consent and permission of landlord and tenant on the other hand categorically denied. Its burden of proof of parting with possession was held to be on landlord. However, landlord in this case had not stated name of alleged sub-lessees whom premises was alleged to have been given by tenant.\n  14. In the present case names of alleged sub-lessees are specifically stated. One of the alleged sub-lessees is claimed by tenant to be his nephew who claimed that he had been living in Punjabi Club and tenant stated that he has been living there since 1974. This ejectment application was filed in 1998. If nephew had been living in Punjabi Club for 24 years surely he must have been in possession of some documents to establish as to whether and in what capacity he had been living there; whether he was owner or tenant. No such document has been produced by him.",

The petitioner approached the respondents for installation of the transformer and electricity connection for the aforesaid Housing Scheme, following which the respondent No.1 issued Demand Note of Rs.3,97,058 and a bill of Rs.12,000 for the cost of material and installation of electricity connection. The petition deposited the said amount in the bank in the account of respondent No. 1. It is the case of petitioner that in spite of the deposit of the demanded amount, the respondents Nos.1 and 2 did not install the transfer and failed to provide the electricity connection to the petitioner. The petitioner pleaded that he moved applications on 17-2-2009 and 17-3-2009 by which he requested the respondent No.1 for installation of 50KV transformer and electricity connection but the respondent did not pay any heed. On one hand, the respondents failed to install transfer and electricity connection to the petitioner and on the other hand the respondent No.3 issued an advance bill of Rs.1,95,563 showing consumption of 16296 units with directions to the petitioner to pay the said bill in advance for three months and thereafter his request for installation of transformer and electricity connection would be considered. The petitioner further pleaded that vide letter No.MOG-1/HESCO/D.B./3724 dated 26-3-2009 the respondent again required the petitioner to make payment of 16296 units in advance bill. The petitioner has called in question, the acts of the respondent by which they were avoiding to install the transformer and electricity connection to him besides demanding the payment of Rs.1,95,563 in advance inter alia, on the ground that actions of the respondents were absolutely illegal, arbitrary and without lawful authority.\n  The respondents filed their comments, in which they have taken the plea that the amount paid by - the petitioner was not the bill of electricity consumption and the payment made by the petitioner was towards cost of the material, out of which Rs.15,000 was the security deposit. In their comments, the respondents further pleaded that it was the routine practice of the department to receive the payment of 16296 units amounting to Rs.195,563 in advance, which -amount is adjustable towards consumption after installation of the electricity meters. The respondent denied the' averments made in the petition.\n  The factum of receipt of the payment through demand note dated 22-10-2009 for Rs.3,97,058 and Rs.15,000 was not denied by the respondents. When the respondent's counsel was asked as to provision of Electricity Act, under which advance bill of the payment is required to be paid, once the respondents have received the requisite amount for transformer, equipments and security deposit, he could not offer plausible explanation except that he contended that it was the practice of the respondents to issue such-bills in advance as security. We find that demand note Annexure \"B\" contains word \"Security Deposit\", which has already been deposited by the petitioner. Moreover, neither the transformer nor the electricity connection has been installed by the respondents and the advance bill issued by the respondent No.3 is not covered under any provision of law. The learned counsel for the respondents had failed to justify such advance bill. We accordingly hold that after receipt of the security deposit, demand by way of advance bill by the respondents was without lawful authority.\n  For the foregoing reasons, we have allowed the petition as prayed with cost of Rs.10,000 to be paid by the officers who were guilty in issuance of such fictitious bill by our short order, dated 29-10-2009.\n  H.B.T./F-26/K Petition allowed.",

It is the case of petitioner that in spite of the deposit of the demanded amount, the respondents Nos.1 and 2 did not install the transfer and failed to provide the electricity connection to the petitioner.

He initiated proceedings for its transfer in his favour. The spot was inspected and vide order, dated 30-10-1967 Deputy Settlement Commissioner passed an order for transfer whereupon a PTO was issued on 3-2-1968. The transfer price and fees were paid and a PTD was issued on 16-4-1974. The grievance made was that he had been repeatedly approaching the local Revenue Officers to implement the said transfer in the Revenue Records but the needful is not being done. Comments were filed by an A.D.C.(G.)/D.S.C., Faisalabad on 14-10-1996. It was admitted that as per Settlement Record, the said petitioner is in possession of the plot and raised structure thereon but it was stated that the Revenue Record does not contain any such entry. It was further explained that the land stands exchanged under orders of Central Government, dated 3-1-1958. Reference was made to a judgment dated 21-7-1990 of a Division Bench of this Court in Writ Petition No.5494 of 1987 whereby PTDs. or TOs. issued upto 12-6-1988 were to be scrutinized and if found genuine proprietary rights were to be allowed. This writ petition was disposed of on 15-10-1996 with a direction to the petitioner to appear before the said officer or Collector, Faisalabad, who will examine the matter.\n  2. Vide order, 'dated 27-11-1997 the A.D.C.(G)/D.S.C. Faisalabad, rejected the application holding the documents to be forged and fabricated.\n  3. Against the said order, dated 27-11-1997 the petitioner filed Writ Petition No.29288 of 1997. The matter was heard on 27-11-1998 and 30-11-1998 by this Court. Contentions of both the parties were noted and the writ petition was allowed and the said order was declared to be without lawful authority. The matter was directed to be decided afresh.\n  4. This time the matter came up before a D.O.(R)/Notified Officer, Sheikhupura, which was transferred to the said office by the Senior Member, Board of Revenue, \"Punjab, vide order, dated 7-10-2002 from the D.O.(R), Faisalabad. The said officer noted the points to be determined in the light of notification dated 12-6-1988 and decided the same and ultimately found the transfer order in favour of the petitioner to be legal and valid and directed the Circle Revenue Officer to attest a mutation in accordance with law. Pursuant to this order, Mutations Nos.32173 and 32178 transferring the land from Provincial Government to Central Government and to the L.Rs. of the said Qudrat Ullah (who had since died) were attested on 30-9-2003.\n  5. Against the order, dated 22-5-2003 of the D.O.(R)/Notified Officer, the respondents filed Writ Petition No.8560 of 2004 in this Court. This writ petition was heard on 18-9-2007 and vide judgment, dated 18-9-2007 the said order was upheld with the finding that the L.Rs. of Qudrat Ullah are transferees through a valid transfer order and are in possession of the property and that the direction for incorporation of their names in the Revenue Record is in accordance with the proven facts and dictates of law. Admittedly, this -judgment was not challenged by anyone, in any manner, prescribed by law.\n  6. According to the petitioner, the Tehsildar City,' Faisalabad, after sanctioning the said mutations himself filed an appeal before D. D.O. (R). Without any notice to the L.Rs. of Qudrat Ullah, the appeal was allowed on the very next day and resultantly the mutations were cancelled. Realizing the illegality of the said act, it was decided to file the said writ petition, which was decided by this Court on 18-9-2007.\n  7. The respondents remained adamant and did not undo the wrong done by them by restoring the earlier mutations or attesting fresh mutations in accordance with the order of the D.O.(R)/Notified Officer as affirmed by this Court. The petitioner then filed Writ Petition No.2993 of 2009 in this Court, which was disposed of on 17-2-2009 with a direction to the Tehsildar City, Faisalabad, to pass appropriate orders on the application filed by the petitioner in accordance with the judgment of this Court.\n  8. Present writ petition has been filed with the grievance that instead of complying with the said judgments, the respondent No.3 filed an appeal before respondent No.2 against the order dated 22-5-2003 of the D.O.(R.)/Notified Officer and simultaneously the respondent No.1 has commenced proceedings upon a reference by respondent No.3. The writ petition came up on 17-4-2009 when all the said facts were noted and the Tehsildar was directed to attest the mutation in accordance with the order of the Notified Officer as affirmed by this Court vide judgment dated 18-9-2007 in Writ Petition No.8560 of 2004. The case then came up on 13-5-2009 when respondents Nos.1, 3 and 4 filed replies. Respondent No.3 stated that she had not filed any appeal while the learned counsel for the other respondents sought time to sort out the matter so that the orders of the Court are duly implemented. The direction was repeated on 1-6-2009. On 5-6-2009 Hafiz Muhammad Yousaf, Advocate filed C.M. No.2413 of 2009 praying that the Member (Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab, be impleaded. The application was allowed in terms that the learned counsel was permitted to address the Court at the time of hearing. On the same date, it was reported that the mutations have been attested in accordance with the orders of the Court. The writ petition was accordingly fixed for hearing.\n  9. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that, in view of the said factual history of the case, the earlier orders have been rightly got implemented by this Court. Mr. Mehmood A. Sheikh, Advocate with reference to judgment, dated 14-4-2009 of the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in Civil Appeal No.625 of 2003 and Civil Appeal No.627 of 2003 as also judgment in the case of Muhammad Ramzan and others v. Member (Rev.)/CSS and others 1997 SCMR 1635 vehemently urges that the earlier order of the D.O.(R.) as well as the judgment of this Court dismissing the writ petition filed by the respondents are per incuriam and this Court cannot be called upon to implement the same. According to him, the land having been exchanged with the State land, there was no question of its being dealt with by the authorities under the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws and as such the transfer order in favour of Qudrat Ullah is void ab initio. Hafiz Muhammad Yousaf, Advocate, also with reference to a judgment, dated 21-4-2009 of the Honourable Supreme Court in C.P. No.557/L of 2004 reiterates the said arguments of Mr. Mehmood A. Sheikh, Advocate. Both the learned counsel also refer to another judgment, dated 10-7-2001 in Civil Appeals Nos.2233 and 2234 of 1998.\n  10. I deem it appropriate, in the first instance, to deal with the arguments based on the said case of Muhammad Ramzan and others 1997 SCMR 1635. By way of the said judgment, several appeals arising out of a common judgment dated 16-1-1994 passed by this Court in several writ petitions, were decided. The leading opinion was expressed by Honourable Munawar Ahmad Mirza, J. The facts of the cases were narrated. The history of the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws as also the intent thereof was explained. Thereafter reference was made to a notification issued on 16-5-1973 by the Chief Settlement Commissioner whereby all available evacuee urban land including the one not yet confirmed to any person against units or evacuee land which may become available in future in all the revenue estates falling within urban limits throughout the Province of Punjab were declared as building sites to be disposed of under section 13 of the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 1958. I may note here that this provision lays down that in future land declared to be a building site by the Chief Settlement Commissioner was to be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1958. Reference was then made to the judgment in the case of Member, Board of Revenue, Punjab (Settlement and Rehabilitation Wing)/Chief Settlement Commissioner, Punjab, Lahore v. Muhammad Mustafa and 74 others 1993 SCMR 732 to observe that it stands specifically .elucidated that neither nature of land could be converted nor proceedings treated as pending even under directions of superior Courts if the same tends to contravene existing law. Then several cases were examined accordingly to derive that when claims were not satisfied or direction issued by Superior Courts regarding subject-matter which inherently suffered from want of jurisdiction, were not complied on concession for allotting alternate urban land to claimants against unsatisfied Produce Index Units even if any concession was made by the Department, otherwise having no authority specially after repealing Act, could not be legitimately sustained. It was accordingly held that by virtue of the said notifications, dated 16-5-1973 no agricultural urban land existed which could be adjusted against unsatisfied verified claims of Produce Index Units and as such the unsatisfied claimants were not entitled to obtain allotment of urban land in satisfaction of pending units as alternate land. Consequently the judgments of this Court mostly based on concession by the Law Officers appearing for the Settlement Department directing allotment of alternate land were held to be per incuriam and not binding.\n  11. In view of the factual history explained above, the said judgment would not be applicable to the facts of the present case, which in fact, was initiated and dealt with under the provisions of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1958 and it was not a case of satisfaction of any Produce Index Units or land claims.\n  12. So far as the said unreported judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondents are concerned, in the matter of said Civil Appeals Nos.625 and 627 of 2003, the case of the appellants before their Lordships, was based on temporary allotment under the Rehabilitation Scheme which was not confirmed. In the matter of C.P. No.557/L of 2004 the plot was sold in auction on 24-8-1968 but it was not confirmed and the Settlement Department refused to issue a PTD and, thus, a suit was filed in which ultimately the said C.P. arose. I may note here that in these two cases, the effect of notification issued by the Provincial Government on 12-6-1988 was not considered. However, in the matter of Civil Appeals Nos.2233 and 2234 of 1998, the matter of Civil Appeals Nos.2233 and 2234 of 1998, the matter was considered with reference to the said notification and one of the appeals was allowed with directions for transfer of alternate land.\n  13. Reverting back to the present case, none of the judgments were passed on any concession. In the first instance, Writ Petition 29288 of 1997 was duly contested by the respondents but was, allowed and the matter was remanded back to the Notified Officer who then passed the said order dated 22-5-2003. Writ Petition No.8560 of 2004 was filed against the said order by the respondents and not by the petitions, which, of course, was contested and was dismissed with observation as noted above and this judgment was not questioned any further. The findings of facts were recorded by the D.O.(R.)/Notified Officer, which were confirmed by this Court and Qudrat Ullah was found to be lawful transferee.\n  14. Needless to state that the case of the petitioner was scrutinized by the D.O.(R.)/Notified Officer in strict accordance with the terms of the notification dated 12-6-1988 as interpreted by this Court and then by the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan, inter alia, in the said Civil Appeals Nos.2233 and 2234 of 1998. I, (sic) this Court dismissing the writ petition of the respondents was not per incuriam and was binding upon both the parties and they were bound to implement the same in letter and spirit. The writ petition is accordingly disposed of in the said terms. No orders as to costs.\n  S.A.K./M-517/L Petition disposed of.",

Sheikh, Advocate with reference to judgment, dated 14-4-2009 of the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in Civil Appeal No.625 of 2003 and Civil Appeal No.627 of 2003 as also judgment in the case of Muhammad Ramzan and others v. Member (Rev.)/CSS and others 1997 SCMR 1635 vehemently urges that the earlier order of the D.O.(R.) as well as the judgment of this Court dismissing the writ petition filed by the respondents are per incuriam and this Court cannot be called upon to implement the same. According to him, the land having been exchanged with the State land, there was no question of its being dealt with by the authorities under the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws and as such the transfer order in favour of Qudrat Ullah is void ab initio. Hafiz Muhammad Yousaf, Advocate, also with reference to a judgment, dated 21-4-2009 of the Honourable Supreme Court in C.P. No.557/L of 2004 reiterates the said arguments of Mr. Mehmood A. Sheikh, Advocate. Both the learned counsel also refer to another judgment, dated 10-7-2001 in Civil Appeals Nos.2233 and 2234 of 1998.\n  10. I deem it appropriate, in the first instance, to deal with the arguments based on the said case of Muhammad Ramzan and others 1997 SCMR 1635. By way of the said judgment, several appeals arising out of a common judgment dated 16-1-1994 passed by this Court in several writ petitions, were decided. The leading opinion was expressed by Honourable Munawar Ahmad Mirza, J. The facts of the cases were narrated. The history of the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws as also the intent thereof was explained. Thereafter reference was made to a notification issued on 16-5-1973 by the Chief Settlement Commissioner whereby all available evacuee urban land including the one not yet confirmed to any person against units or evacuee land which may become available in future in all the revenue estates falling within urban limits throughout the Province of Punjab were declared as building sites to be disposed of under section 13 of the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 1958. I may note here that this provision lays down that in future land declared to be a building site by the Chief Settlement Commissioner was to be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1958. Reference was then made to the judgment in the case of Member, Board of Revenue, Punjab (Settlement and Rehabilitation Wing)/Chief Settlement Commissioner, Punjab, Lahore v. Muhammad Mustafa and 74 others 1993 SCMR 732 to observe that it stands specifically .elucidated that neither nature of land could be converted nor proceedings treated as pending even under directions of superior Courts if the same tends to contravene existing law. Then several cases were examined accordingly to derive that when claims were not satisfied or direction issued by Superior Courts regarding subject-matter which inherently suffered from want of jurisdiction, were not complied on concession for allotting alternate urban land to claimants against unsatisfied Produce Index Units even if any concession was made by the Department, otherwise having no authority specially after repealing Act, could not be legitimately sustained. It was accordingly held that by virtue of the said notifications, dated 16-5-1973 no agricultural urban land existed which could be adjusted against unsatisfied verified claims of Produce Index Units and as such the unsatisfied claimants were not entitled to obtain allotment of urban land in satisfaction of pending units as alternate land. Consequently the judgments of this Court mostly based on concession by the Law Officers appearing for the Settlement Department directing allotment of alternate land were held to be per incuriam and not binding.\n  11. In view of the factual history explained above, the said judgment would not be applicable to the facts of the present case, which in fact, was initiated and dealt with under the provisions of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1958 and it was not a case of satisfaction of any Produce Index Units or land claims.\n  12. So far as the said unreported judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondents are concerned, in the matter of said Civil Appeals Nos.625 and 627 of 2003, the case of the appellants before their Lordships, was based on temporary allotment under the Rehabilitation Scheme which was not confirmed. In the matter of C.P. No.557/L of 2004 the plot was sold in auction on 24-8-1968 but it was not confirmed and the Settlement Department refused to issue a PTD and, thus, a suit was filed in which ultimately the said C.P. arose. I may note here that in these two cases, the effect of notification issued by the Provincial Government on 12-6-1988 was not considered. However, in the matter of Civil Appeals Nos.2233 and 2234 of 1998, the matter of Civil Appeals Nos.2233 and 2234 of 1998, the matter was considered with reference to the said notification and one of the appeals was allowed with directions for transfer of alternate land.\n  13. Reverting back to the present case, none of the judgments were passed on any concession. In the first instance, Writ Petition 29288 of 1997 was duly contested by the respondents but was, allowed and the matter was remanded back to the Notified Officer who then passed the said order dated 22-5-2003. Writ Petition No.8560 of 2004 was filed against the said order by the respondents and not by the petitions, which, of course, was contested and was dismissed with observation as noted above and this judgment was not questioned any further. The findings of facts were recorded by the D.O.(R.)/Notified Officer, which were confirmed by this Court and Qudrat Ullah was found to be lawful transferee.\n",

Consequently the bank initiated disciplinary proceeding 'against the respondent and having considered his reply to the show-cause notice not satisfactory, appointed an Inquiry Officer at Islamabad to hold a regular inquiry into the allegation of misappropriation. The Inquiry Officer at the conclusion of the enquiry having found the respondent guilty of the charge submitted report accordingly and the competent authority on the basis of inquiry report awarded the respondent major penalty of dismissal from service vide order dated 21-4-2008. The 'order of dismissal from service was assailed by the respondent before the Chief Court in a writ petition and Chief Court vide judgment, dated 12-11-2008 allowed the writ petition with the direction of reinstatement of respondent in service. The petitioners being not satisfied with the judgment of Chief Court have challenged the same before this Court through this petition inter alia on the grounds:---\n  Firstly, the Muslim Commercial Bank is a private bank and staff service rules of the bank are not statutory rules to be enforced through the process of writ petition and secondly the relation between the Bank and respondent being that of Master and servant, the writ petition before Chief Court was not maintainable rather respondent could avail the remedy of civil suit for damages before the Civil Court of competent jurisdiction.\n  The Muslim Commercial Bank' admittedly is a private bank with its Zonal and Head Office at Islamabad and Lahore. The administrative and other affairs of the bank are controlled by its management at its Zonal and Head Office. The alleged financial irregularities were committed by the respondent at Skardu and inquiry into these irregularities was held at Islamabad whereas the final order of dismissal of respondent from service was also passed by the Circle Office at Islamabad on the direction of Head Office at Lahore. In view thereof the essential question for determination would be whether cause of action foravailing legal remedy arised in favour of respondent at the place where the final order was passed or at Skardu where he was posted at the time of alleged transaction of misappropriation.\n  The learned counsel for the respondent without meeting the objection to the maintainability of writ petition before the Chief Court and satisfying us about the jurisdiction of the Court in the Northern Areas to adjudicate the matter submitted, that since the alleged misappropriation took place at Skardu therefore, the Courts in Gilgit Baltistan would have the concurrent jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter and objection relating to the jurisdiction of Chief Court to entertain the writ petition has no legal force.\n  The question relating to the territorial jurisdiction of the Courts in Northern Areas was to be necessarily determined with reference to the cause of action in terms of section 20 of C.P.C., which provides as under:---\n  \"Other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of action arises---Subject to the limitations aforesaid every suit shall be instituted' in a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction---\n  (a) The defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or\n  (b) Any of the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the leave of the Court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution; or\n  (c) The cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.\n  Under the law a suit can be filed within local limits of the Court, within the jurisdiction of which cause of action arose wholly or partly. The terms cause of action refers to the infringement of legal right and not merely the allegation on the basis of which such right is infringed. In the present case the proceedings against the respondents were initiated at Islamabad for the alleged misappropriation during his posting at Skardu and final order of his removal from service was also passed by the competent authority at Islamabad, therefore, notwithstanding the fact that alleged transaction of misappropriation happened at Skardu where the petitioner-Bank also carries business, the cause of action would certainly arise in favour of respondent out of the order of his dismissal from service which was passed at Islamabad and not at Skardu where the transaction of misappropriation of money took place during his tenure as Manager. The cause of action in such cases may be referred to the grounds on the basis of which relief is sought and not only with reference to the place of transaction on the basis of which an action is taken. The 'respondent claimed the right to continue in bank service which was infringed by the petitioners at Islamabad and thus cause of action wholly or partly arised in favour of respondent within the local limit of Courts At Islamabad. The mere fact that the transaction of misappropriation took place in the Skardu Branch of the Bank would not give rise to the cause of action for the purpose of invoking the jurisdiction of Courts in Northern Areas, consequently, the contention of the learned counsel that cause of action for the purpose of availing remedy against the order of dismissal of respondent from service arised out of the alleged transaction of misappropriation at Skardu where petitioners also carry business, therefore, the Courts in Northern Areas would have jurisdiction to competently adjudicate the matter has no substance. The respondent was aggrieved of the action taken against him by the bank at Islamabad and final order of dismissal from service was also passed within the local limits of Courts at Islamabad, therefore, the Courts in Northern Areas would have no jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter.\n  In consequence to the above discussion, we while holding that the Chief Court was not competent to entertain the writ petition and adjudicate the matter for want of jurisdiction set aside the impugned judgment. The respondent may if so advised seeking benefit of section 14 of the Limitation Act avail appropriate remedy before the proper Court in accordance with law.\n  In implementation of the judgment of Chief Court, the bank has reinstated the respondent in service, therefore, in consequence to this judgment, the petitioners will not pass an adverse order undoing the order of reinstatement of respondent in service which will hold field for a period of two months unless a contrary order is earlier passed by the Court seized of the matter.\n  In the light of foregoing reasons this petition is converted into an appeal and is allowed in the above terms with no orders as to costs.\n  H.B.T./18/Glt.?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

The suit was filed by a private limited company Haji Suleman Goawala & Sons Limited through its Managing Director, Iqbal Suleman Goawala against owners of the above mentioned 95 acres of land belonging to Dawood family.\n  2. The suit was originally filed in this Court and numbered as Suit No.101 of 1975. Upon change of pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court, the suit stood transferred to the Civil Court, Malir and renumbered there, as Suit No.339 of 1996. The suit was dismissed on 29-4-2004, against which appeal was preferred which was allowed by the Additional District Judge, Malir vide his judgment, dated 23-12-2005. This judgment passed in first appeal is being impugned in these three separate 2nd appeals that have been preferred by the owners of the lands and are being disposed of through this common judgment.\n  3. For convenience sakes, the appellants of these appeals, who are owners of 95 acres and were defendants in the suit, shall be described in this judgment as \"the defendants\" and the respondent, who was plaintiff in the suit shall be described as \"the plaintiff\".\n  4. The case of the plaintiff in the suit was that negotiations between Mr. Iqbal Suleman Goawala, the Managing Director of the plaintiff and Mr. Ahmed Dawood, the head of the Dawood family culminated in a deal for the sale of 95 acres of land at a price of Rs.3,000 per acre i.e. for Rs.285,000 for the entire 95 acres. Mr. Goawala paid an advance payment of Rs.100,000 to Mr. Ahmed Dawood through Cheque No.CBY447371 dated 31-10-1974. It was also the case of the plaintiff that transaction was agreed to be completed within 15 days. According to the plaintiff, this deal was struck with Mr. Ahmed Dawood after all other defendants who owned the land concurred with the transaction. The cheque dated 31-10-1974 for Rs.1,00,000 paid towards advance, was cleared by the bank on 4-11-1974 and upon such clearance, a receipt dated 4-1-1974 was issued to the plaintiff. It was also the case of the plaintiff that in spite of several reminders, when the defendants failed to complete the transaction within the stipulated period of 15 days, the plaintiff became suspicious, which led to serving of legal notice, dated 17-12-1974 on the defendants. In the notice, the plaintiff called upon the defendants to get the transaction completed within the next 15 days, failing which legal, action for seeking specific performance of the contract as well as for damages would be initiated.\n  5. The plaintiff's legal notice dated 17-12-1974 was replied by the defendants through their counsel's letter dated 31-12-1974. In the reply, the defendants disputed the sale consideration amount and claimed that it was settled atRs.6,00,000 and not Rs.2,85,000. It was also claimed in the reply that the balance sale consideration amount of Rs.5,00,000 was to be paid by the plaintiff within seven days from the date of the issuance of the cheque dated 31-10-1974 and as time was made the essence of the contract, hence according to the defendants, upon plaintiff's failure to make the payment by 7-11-1974, the contract came to an end and the advance amount in terms of the oral agreement was to be returned back to the plaintiff. In the defendants' reply dated 31-12-1974 it is clearly mentioned that Cheque 'bearing No.CBW 574892 dated 8-11-1974 for Rs.1,00,000 received as advance payment was returned under covering letter dated 8-11-1974 and handed over at the shop of the plaintiff on 9-11-1974.\n  6. On 24-2-1975 the plaintiff filed the suit for specific performance of the contract against the defendants wherein damages were also claimed in the alternative.\n  7. After going through the impugned judgment and the pleadings, basically following questions need to be examined by this Court.\n  (I) Whether the parties had reached a concluded contract and if yes on what terms and as it binding also on defendants Nos.3 namely Suleman Dawood?\n  (II) Which of the two contracting parties committed breach of the contract?\n  (III) Whether the contract came to an end upon plaintiff's receiving back the advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 that it paid to the defendants on 31-10-1974 i.e. at the time of finalizing the deal?\n  (IV) Whether the Managing Director of the plaintiff-Company was legally competent to file the suit?\n  8. Mr. Farogh Naseem and Mr. Abid S. Zuberi, appearing for the defendants in 2nd Appeals Nos.9 of 2006 and 31 of 2006 respectively argued that there was no concluded contract between the parties. They submitted that firstly the receipt dated 4-11-1974 does not disclose as to what was the sale consideration that was settled between the parties and secondly it does not mention the time within which the transaction was to be completed. They, therefore, argued that there was no concluded and binding contract between the parties and it was for this reason the receipt dated 4-11-1974 was described at \"Katcha receipt\". Apart from the argument that the receipt did not evince a concluded contract, they further argued that receipt was executed by a person who is not the exclusive owner of 95 acres of land and submitted that a person who himself does not hold proprietary interest or authority on behalf of other owners, cannot lawfully bind them with the contract that he entered into with the plaintiff, if at all there was any concluded contract. They further contended that the burden of proof to establish a binding and concluded contract was on the plaintiff-Company, which it failed to discharge and the relief of specific performance being discretionary ought not to have been granted by the 1st Appellate Court. In this regard they relied upon the cases reported in 1979 CLC 280 relevant pages 341 and 344.\n  9. The defendants' counsel next argued that Mr. Asif Iqbal, who was one of the Directors of the plaintiff-Company and appeared as its witness was only 14 years age at the time of the alleged transaction of sale and admittedly he was not even present at the time of negotiations. Therefore, they submitted that his statement is of no evidentiary value.\n  10. The defendants' counsel then argued that no Board Resolution was passed by the plaintiff-Company, authorizing its Managing Director to file suit against the defendants, therefore, in absence of authorization to file suit, it was not maintainable in law and liable to be dismissed on this score alone. They contended that the Minutes of Board Meetings that were produced by the plaintiff as Exh.6/14 nowhere make mention of the resolution authorizing its Managing Director to file the suit on behalf of the plaintiff-Company. They therefore, submitted that the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside and the judgment and decree passed by the Civil Court whereby the suit was dismissed may be restored.\n  11. Mr. Mushtaq A. Memon, who appeared in 2nd Appeal No.9 of 2006 on behalf of the plaintiff argued that when the receipt dated 4-11-1974 is read with the contents of the defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974, it becomes quite apparent that a binding contract having all the ingredients of a concluded contract came into existence. He, further submitted that defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974 is duly acknowledged and owned by the defendants in their written statements while making rely to paragraphs 6 to 17 of the plaint and therefore, the only controversy that remained to tie decided was as to what was the, actual sale consideration settled between the parties i.e. whether it was 2,85,000 or 6,00,000 and this can be ascertained by appreciating the evidence that has come on the record of the case. He then submitted that evidence clearly establishes that fact that the sale consideration was settled at Rs.3,000 per acre i.e. Rs.285,000 for the entire lot of 95 acres and not Rs.6,00,000 as claimed by the defendants. With regard to the defendants' argument that the receipt, dated 4-11-1974 was not a binding and concluded contract, Mr. Mushtaq A. Memon relied upon the cases reported in 2004 MLD 1778 and 2005 MLD 1745 at page 1748 in order to show that receipt by itself can be termed as contract if it has all the, ingredients of a concluded contract.\n  12. Mr. Mushtaq A. Memon also argued that the defendants during the pendency of the suit sought certain amendments to the written statements which were allowed subject to all just exceptions but this permission does not mean that under its garb the defendants can improve upon their case. He submitted that law does not permit a party to improve upon its case and deviate from its original pleadings as in proving ones case a party has to confine its case to its original pleadings. He, therefore, submitted that any evidence that was led by the defendants beyond the original pleadings is not to be looked into.\n  13. Mr. Mushtaq A. Memon next argued that those defendants who have filed their separate written statements ought to have produced their witnesses and failure to do so means that they have no defence to offer. In support of this contention, he relied upon the cases reported in PLD 1970 SC 25, PLD 1975 SC 598, PLD 1977 SC 109 at page 133, 1979 CLC 338, 2003 MLD 205 at page 209, 2008 CLD 85 at page 91.\n  14. This is not a case where no one has appeared as witness on behalf of the defendants. Defendant No.4 appears as his own witness but due to his advance age and mental incapacity he was unable to continue with his deposition. On behalf of rest of the defendants, defendant No.1 appeared as witness. Where there is common cause or common defence then it is not necessary that each of the defendants should appear to defend their stand. Any of them can appear as witness.\n  15. In reply to the defendants' argument that suit was not competently filed, Mr. Mushtaq A. Memon referred to the provisions of Order XXIX, rule 1 of Civil Procedure Code and relied upon the cases reported in 2003 SCMR 318, 1996 CLC 1064 at page 1067, 2003 CLD 1497 at page 1503, AIR 1937 Nag. 379, PLD 190 Lah. 208 at page 210 and contented that suit was competently filed.\n  16. Mr. Khalid Anwar; who appeared for the plaintiff in Appeal No.31 of 2006 argued that in the second appeal filed under section 100, C.P.C. the question of fact are not to be gone into and only questions of law are to be examined. He argued that the defendants in their respective written statements have owned the contents of the letter, dated 31-12-1974, wherein the contract has been admitted and the only dispute was raised in the letter dated 31-12-1974 was that the sale consideration was settled at Rs.6,00,000 and not Rs.2,85,000. He argued that the issue with regard to the actual sale consideration has already been decided by the 1st Appellate Court on the basis of evidence on record and therefore, this question of fact cannot be gone into in this 2nd appeal. Mr. Khalid Anwar further argued that the defendants in support of the averments made in the written statements have not led any evidence to establish that the sale consideration was Rs.6,00,000 and the version of the plaintiff that the sale consideration was settled at Rs.2,85,000 having gone unchallenged, the same would not be open to question in 2nd appeal. He supported this argument by submitting that when the plaintiff's witness P. W.1 deposed in his cross-examination that the sale consideration was Rs.2,85,000 i.e. Rs.3,000 per acre, no question was put to him in cross-examination. He submitted that when a party is not cross-examined on any point then such point is deemed to have been admitted by the other party.\n  17. Mr. Khalid Anwar next argued that absence of Board Resolution was not fatal to plaintiff's as Article 31 of the Articles of Association of the plaintiff-Company duly authorizes its Board to appoint any Director to act as its Managing Director for a period of three years and Article 30 authorizes the Managing Director to run the affairs of the plaintiff-Company. He therefore, submitted that on account of authorization contained in Articles 30 and 31 of the Articles of Association, there was no need for any resolution from the Board in order to authorize its Managing Director to file suit. He placed reliance on the eases reported in 1996 CLC 1064 at pages 1067, 2003 CLD 1497 at page 1053, 2004 MLD 1778 at page 1780, 2008 CLC 727 at page 730, Muhammad Siddiq v. Australiasia Bank Ltd. PLD 1966 SC 684 at page 1067, Iftikhar Mamdot v. Ghulam Nabi Corp. PLD 1971 SC 550, Central Bank of India v. Taj-ud-Din Abdur Rauf 1992 SCMR 846 and Pemco International v. Hubei Machinery Corp. 2005 CLD 74.\n  18. Mr. Khalid Anwar lastly argued that all the defendants have not preferred second appeal against the judgment passed by the Appellate Court and, therefore, insofar as their cases are concerned, the impugned judgment has attained finality against them and is not open to challenge.\n  19. Mr. Farogh Naseem, who appears in Appeal No.9 of 2006 for defendant No.3, in reply submitted that defendant No.4 never owned the transaction in his written statement which he filed separately and therefore, insofar as the land belonging to defendant No.4 is concerned, there was no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the said defendants.\n  20. Mr. Farogh Naseem and Mr. Abid Zubairi also contended that none of the Articles of Association authorize its Managing Director to file suit on behalf of the company, therefore, the case-law referred to by plaintiff's counsel is of no help to the plaintiffs' case. They submitted that as Article 30 or 31 of the Articles of Association, nowhere give authorization to anyone to file suit on behalf of the plaintiff-Company, therefore, it was necessary that Board should have passed resolution, without which the suit was incompetent in law and liable to be dismissed.\n  They submitted that the First Appellate Court committed error by totally ignoring this aspect of the case and did not give any findings on the maintainability of the suit.\n  21. In reply to Mr. Khalid Anwar's argument that under section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code, a Court hearing 2nd appeal cannot examine the questions of fact and only questions of law are to be examined, Mr. Abid S. Zuberi, contended that the construction of documents is always a question of law and not of fact and therefore, this Court in second appeal can examine the documents and interpret their true meaning and import in order to resolve the controversy. He relied upon the cases reported in PLD 1974 SC 204, 1996 CLC 1616; 1986 MLD 206; 1985 PLC 1321 and PLD 1966 Dacca 486. In the case of Gulzar Khan v. Shahzad Bibi reported in PLD 1974 SC 204 it was held by the Honourable Supreme Court that proper construction of a document is a question of law and not of fact. Hence in my view the interpretation of documents around which whole transaction in question revolves is nothing but to decide a question of law in terms of the ratio of the above referred judgment of the Supreme Court. In the, case of Ahmad Khan v. Rasul Shah and others reported in PLD 1975 SC 311 it was held that right construction of documents has always been regarded as question of law which the High Court is not precluded from considering in second appeal. There has been a flood of case-law in support of this proposition. In the case of Gulzar Khan v. Mst. Shahzada Bibi and others reported in PLD 1974 SC 204, it was held as under:--\n  \"While it is undoubtedly correct that an inference drawn from evidence amounts to a finding of fact, yet it is well-settled that the question of the proper construction of document is a question of law and not of fact. In the present case, the question turns solely on the construction of the documents by which the transaction was evidenced and therefore, the High Court was right in regarding this as a question of law and giving its own interpretation, an interpretation with which we agree.\"\n  22. With regard to the argument that some of the defendants have not filed their own appeals, Mr. Abid Zubairi contended that under Order XLI, rule 32 of Civil Procedure Code the Court can grant the relief to a respondent who has not preferred appeal. He relied upon cases reported in PLD 1965 SC 15 and PLD 1992 SC 590.\n  23. Mr. Khalid Anwar, learned counsel in response to the arguments of Mr. Abid S. Zuberi in respect to applicability of Order XLI, rule 32 has placed reliance on the cases reported in Hasan Muhammad v. Jan Muhammad PLD 1982 Lah. 132, Shah Muhammad V. Muhammad Baksh PLD 372 SC 321, Kanwal Nain v. Fateh Khan PLD 1983 SC 53, 1996 SCMR 1862, PLD 1973 SC 295 and AIR 1927 Born. 128 and submitted that no such relief can be granted.\n  24. The contents of the plaint and the contents of the written statements are basically the reflection of the stands which the plaintiff and the defendants have respectively taken with regard to the transaction in question in the legal notice dated 17-12-1974 and its reply dated 31-12-1974. The only exception is that defendant No.4 i.e. Mr. Suleman Dawood in his written statement has taken the plea that he neither gave his consent nor authorized anyone to enter into any sale transaction in relation to his 10 acres out of disputed 95 acres of land and unlike other defendants he did not own the contents of the letter, dated 31-12-1974 that was sent on behalf of the defendants in reply to plaintiff's legal notice, dated 17-12-1974.\n  25. After the disclosure of the respective positions of the parties in their pleadings, no evidence which deviates from or is contrary to the pleadings is to be looked into. Rights and obligations of the respective parties are always to be determined keeping in view only such pleas that have been taken by them in their respective pleadings. The evidence that is adduced by the parties is also to be looked into only to the extent it supports or opposes the pleas that have been taken by the parties in their pleadings. Any piece of evidence which is beyond the scope of the pleadings cannot be considered while deciding a controversy. This is a well-established legal principle. A Division Bench of this Court in the case of Ehteshamuddin Qureshi v. Pakistan Steel Mills reported in 2004 MLD 36. held that a party cannot be allowed to lead evidence contrary to its pleadings nor could a party be permitted to take a plea different than the plea which it has taken in its pleadings and any part of the evidence which is beyond the pleadings is ought to be overlooked as improvement of the nature being afterthought and impermissible in law.\n  26. I would now examine the argument that failure to adduce evidence is fatal to ones case. A plaintiff has to adduce evidence in support of his pleas that he has taken in his plaint. However, no evidence is required to establish a plea which is either admitted or remained uncontroverted by the defendant in his written statement. Similarly, unless a plea which a defendant has taken in his written statement is admitted or has not been controverted by the plaintiff in his evidence, then too, applying the same principle, requires no evidence from the defendant to prove such a plea. Adducing evidence is not a legal requirement which is to be fulfilled in' every eventuality. Evidence is required to be adduced by a party, be it a plaintiff or defendant, only to establish disputed questions so that the Court is able to resolve conflicting claims. Where record of the case reflect that a party's plea has either been admitted or has remained uncontroverted by the other side, either in its pleadings or in the evidence, then adducing evidence to establish an admitted or uncontroverted plea would obviously be an exercise in futility.\n  27. A closer examination of the pleas that have been taken in the plaint and the written statements by the respective parties show that the controversy with regard to the disputed transaction basically revolves around four documents. The first of these documents is receipt dated 4-11-1974 (Exh.5/1). The second document is letter dated 8-11-1974 written by Osman Suleman on behalf of the defendants to the plaintiff. The third document is plaintiff's legal notice dated 17-12-1974 (Exh.6/12) and the fourth is reply dated 31-12-1974 (Exh.6/13) that was made to plaintiff's legal notice dated 17-12-1974. The second of these four documents i.e. defendants' letter dated 8-11-1974 to the plaintiff though was never produced in evidence but its contents have been reproduced by the defendants in Exh.6/13.\n  28. The first document is the receipt dated 4-11-1974 that was executed by Mr. Osman Suienian on behalf of the defendants acknowledges the receipt of advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 which the plaintiff paid through a cheque dated 31-10-1974. In the receipt dated 4-11-1974, neither the sale consideration nor the time for completion of the transaction is mentioned.\n  29. The second document is defendants' letter dated 8-11-1974 with which defendant enclosed Cheque No.CBW574892 dated 8-11-1974 for Rs.1,00,000 towards the return of the advance amount received by them at the time of entering into the transaction. The defendants delivered this letter along with the cheque to the plaintiff on 9-11-1974. This letter dated 8-11-1974 that was delivered to the plaintiff though was not produced in evidence by the plaintiff but its contents have been reproduced by the defendants in this letter dated 31-12-1974 that was produced in evidence as Exh.6/13. In the letter dated 8-11-1974, the defendant while addressing the plaintiff have stated the circumstances in which the advance payment was being returned. The defendants state \"Please find enclosed a Cheque No.CBW574892, dated 8-11-1974 for Rs.1,00,000 which you had given to us in respect of sale of land. Since you have not fulfilled the conditions of sale we had agreed upon this amount is being returned to you\". It is surprising to note that the advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 was received back by the plaintiff on 9-11-1974 yet in its legal notice dated 17-12-1974 as well as in the plaint the factum of receiving- back the advance payment has not been mentioned. The contents of letter, dated 8-11-1974, which were reproduced in defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974 (Exh.6/13) were not denied by the plaintiff in its evidence. The return of the advance amount back from the defendants was also admitted by plaintiff's witness Haji Sharif during his cross-examination. If at all there was any plausible justification for the plaintiff to receive back the advance payment and yet maintain its right to seek enforcement of the, contract some explanation' ought to have been given by the plaintiff in its evidence but there is none.\n  30. The third document is the legal notice, dated 17-12-1974 that was sent by the plaintiff to the defendants through Osman Suleman. In this document it is stated that all defendants of 95 acres had agreed to sell the land at the rate of Rs.3,000 per acre and as the defendants failed to complete the transaction within 15 days as agreed between the parties, they should complete the same within 15 days failing which legal action would be taken.\n  31. The fourth document is letter dated 31-12-1974 sent on behalf of the defendants in reply to plaintiff's legal notice dated 17-12-1974. In the said reply it was claimed that the total sale consideration was settled at Rs.6,00,000 and not Rs.2,85,000 and the balance sale consideration of Rs.5,00,000 was payable within one week of the issuance of the cheque for advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 i.e. one week from 31-10-1974. It was also claimed in this letter that as the plaintiff failed to complete the transaction by 7-11-1974, the advance payment was, returned to it vide Cheque No.CBW 574892 dated 8-11-1974 with covering letter dated 8-11-1974 that was delivered to the plaintiff at his shop on 9-11-1974. As stated earlier, the contents of the covering letter dated 8-11-1974 are reproduced in the reply dated 31-12-1974 have never been denied in any manner by the plaintiff at any stage of the proceedings.\n  32. Now the first document i.e. receipt dated 4-11-1974 is not executed by all the defendants nor it was established in evidence that Mr. Osman Suleman who executed the receipt and made reply to plaintiff's legal notice dated 17-12-1974 was holding any written authority on defendants' behalf to enter into sale transaction with the plaintiff. Except for defendant No.4 i.e. Mr. Suleman Dawood, the contents of the reply dated 31-12-1974, that was made to plaintiff's legal notice dated 17-12-1974, have been acknowledged and owned by all the defendants in their written statements. When the contents of the receipt dated 4-11-1974 are read with the contents of the fourth document i.e. letter dated 31-12-1974, it becomes quite apparent that undoubtedly parties had entered into a contract and its existence has been acknowledged by all such defendants who have owned and adopted the contents of the letter dated 31-12-1974 in their written statements. Therefore, it cannot be said that there was no concluded contract between the parties and the contentions of the defendants counsel in this regard have no force. Only defendant No.4, Mr. Suleman Dawood has totally denied that he gave any concurrence or authorization to enter into any such transaction in relation to the land owned by him and therefore, to the extent of his land only it can be said that contract was not binding on him.\n  33. The absence of time for the performance of the contract in the receipt dated 4-11-1974 is also of no legal consequence for the reason that when time for the performance of a contract is not specified, it has to be performed within a reasonable time. Section 46 of the Contract Act provides for such eventuality. Therefore, even if parties have not specified any time for the performance of a contract, the same does not make it unenforceable in law. A Court can read into such contracts a time which it deems reasonable for its performance, keeping in view the circumstances of each contract. However, in order to find out as to which of the two parties were at fault in the performance of contract keeping in view their respective pleadings as to the time for performance, it is necessary to first examine the evidence on record. I shall therefore, proceed to examine the question as to what was the time that was settled for the performance of the contract.\n  34. The cheque for the advance payment is dated 31-10-1974 and in terms of defendants letter dated 8-11-1974, the transaction was to be completed by 7-11-1974 i.e. within one week from the issuance of the cheque dated 31-10-1974. In defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974 it is stated that time was made' the essence of the contract and upon failure to make payment within stipulated time, the advance amount was to be returned back to the plaintiff. Hence, according to defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974, the time for completing the transaction ended on 7-11-1974 and as by then the plaintiff did not make payment of the balance sale consideration, the contract stood terminated and for this reason defendants returned the advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 back to the plaintiff on 9-11-1974. All these assertions are contained in the defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974 that was produced in evidence as Exh.6/13. Hence it has undisputedly come on record that the defendants returned the advance payment through a cheque dated 8-11-1974 which was delivered to the plaintiff on 9-11-1974 i.e. on the 9th day of entering into the contract and the plaintiff on its part accepted the return of the same without any objection. This return of the advance payment and its acceptance by the plaintiff appears to be quite in consonance with the stand taken by the defendants in their letter dated 31-12-1974 and shows that the parties had agreed to complete the transaction within a very short period of time otherwise there was no occasion for the plaintiff to receive back the advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 on 9-11-1974 i.e. on the ninth day of striking the deal for the purchase of the land without any protest.\n  35. The fact that the transaction was to be completed within seven days from the issuance of the cheque dated 31-10-1974 or in other words by 7-11-1974 is also established from the fact that plaintiff's own witness Mr. Sharif in his cross-examination has stated that when he .gave the receipt dated 4-11-1974 to Mr. Goawala, he pointed out that neither the price of the land nor the balance sale consideration is mentioned in the receipt to which the witness replied that as the transaction would be completed within two-three days, Mr. Goawala should not be worried about such omissions. The statement of plaintiff's witness at least goes to show that when the receipt was delivered there were only two-three left for the completion of the transaction. When seven days for the completion of the transaction, as claimed by the defendants, are counted from the date of tendering the cheque for advance payment i.e. 31-10-1974, or the two-three days, as stated by plaintiff's witness Mr. Sharif, are counted from the date of the issuance of the receipt dated 4-11-1974, the time for completion of the transaction invariably comes to 7-11-1974. This was precisely the case of the defendants in their letter dated 31-12-1974 as well as in their written statements. On the other hand, the plaintiff in the plaint has taken the plea that the transaction was to be completed within fifteen days i.e. day 15-11-1974. If that was so the why the plaintiff received back the advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 from the defendants on 9-11-1974 i.e. on the ninth day of the transaction and that too without any protest. If at all there was any justification for receiving back the advance payment before the time for completion of the transaction has expired then the plaintiff should have stated so and explained his position at any subsequent stage. However, for unknown reasons, the plaintiff in its legal notice dated 17-12-1974 made no mention of the defendants' letter dated 8-11-1974 or of the cheque that was enclosed with it. When the return of the advance payment and its acceptance by the plaintiff without any objection on 9-11-1974 is taken into consideration, it becomes absolutely clear that the plaintiff accepted the return of the advance payment on the ninth day of entering upon the contract only for the reason that it was unable to complete the transaction before the return of the advance payment and the time for performance was certainly before the return of the advance payment. No other conclusion could be drawn when the plaintiff itself choose not to give any explanation of its own in its pleadings or even in its evidence for the examination of the Court.\n  36. The return of advance payment and its acceptance by the _ plaintiff on 9-11-1974 has also establishes another plea of the defendants that it was also agreed between the parties that in case of plaintiff's failure to complete the transaction by 7-11-1974, the advance payment E was to be returned back to the plaintiff. The defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974 contains reference to defendant's earlier letter dated 8-11-1974. In fact the contents of letter, dated 8-11-1974 have been reproduced in letter dated 31-12-1974. In the letter dated 8-11-1974, the circumstances in which the advance payment was returned are clearly mentioned. The defendants in the letter dated 8-11-1974 while addressing the plaintiff has stated \"please find enclosed a Cheque No.CBW 574892, dated 8-11-1974 for Rs.1,00,000 which you had given to us in respect of sale of land. Since you have not fulfilled the conditions of sale we had agreed upon, this amount is being returned to you\". There is absolutely no denial of the contents of the letter, dated 8-11-1974. hence there is absolutely no reason not to believe its contents. The cumulative effect of the return of the advance amount on the ninth day of entering into the contract and its acceptance by the plaintiff without any protest is that the parties from their own conduct demonstrated that they intended to terminate the contract.\n37. Where a purchaser accepts the return of the earnest money without any protest, then this fact by itself amounts to putting an end to the contract, irrespective of the fact that the time fixed between the parties for the performance of the contract has expired or not. The plaintiff, therefore, by receiving back the advance amount, had in fact given up all his rights that he possessed under the contract. Such being the position emerging from the contract of the plaintiff itself, it matters not whether time was the essence of the contract or what was the actual sale consideration that was settled between the parties. The plaintiff from its own conduct of accepting the return of the advance payment has amply demonstrated that whatever were the terms of the contract, it has put an end to it on 9-11-1974.\n  38. Even in contracts where time is not of the essence, the purchaser has to demonstrate that at all material times he was ready and willing to perform his part of the contract. I have also noticed that the plaintiff's witness Mr. Ismail in his deposition has stated that after four-five days of reaching the contract, 'Mr. Ahmed Dawood demanded from Mr. Goawala the balance sale consideration and when the said witness took the amount of Rs.2,00,000 from Mr. Goawala and offered the same to Mr. Ahmed Dawood he refused to accept the same and thereafter parties exchanged legal notices. This witness i.e. Mr. Ismail does not say what was the reason given by Mr. Ahmed Dawood for not accepting the balance sale consideration when according to this witness, the demand for payment of the balance sale consideration came from Mr. Ahmed Dawood himself. If Mr. Ahmed Dawood, after making demand refused to accept the same only because he demanded more than what was agreed upon, ten plaintiff's witness ought to have stated so in his deposition, which he has not. On the other hand if Mr. Ahmed Dawood never demanded more than the agreed sale consideration, then why would he refuse to receive the balance sale consideration offered to him just after four-five days of entering into the contract when he had himself demanded the same to be paid to him. The only reasons one can think of is that the plaintiff failed to offer the balance sale consideration with in the time stipulated for the performance of the contract. When such refusal, if there was any, is looked at in the context of defendants' plea that the transaction was to be completed by 7-11-1974, it proves the fact that defendants' refusal was on account of plaintiff's failure to offer the balance sale consideration within seven days entering into the contract. It also demonstrated that the plaintiff was not ready and willing to complete the transaction within the stipulated seven days. Not only this, the plaintiff on its part then accepted the return of the earnest money which he paid to the defendants as advance payment. This too clearly demonstrated that it was no more willing to get the transaction completed and was agreeable to put an end to it by accepting the turn of the advance payment. In order to retain its right to see enforcement of the contract, the plaintiff ought to have demonstrated that he was ready and willing to perform its part of the contract at all material times and should not have received back, the advance payment. After accepting the return of the advance amount, nothing was left' to be enforced. Thus, the contract simply stood terminated by the conduct of both the parties which appears to be the mutual intent at the relevant time.\n  39. With regard to the dispute as to what was the actual sale consideration, the plaintiff claimed that the sale consideration was settled at Rs.2,85,000. The defendants on their part claimed that sale consideration was Rs.6,00,000. Though the sale consideration is not mentioned in the receipt dated 4-11-1974, one thing is clear. At the time of making advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 the parties had agreed to a certain definite price. If the price was to be determined at some subsequent stage after making the advance payment, then the defendants ought to have taken such plea in their letter, dated 31-12-1974 or in their written statements. But they have not pleaded so. Therefore, it is clear that price was settled but for some reason it was not mentioned in the receipt. In any case, as the plaintiff, from his own conduct i.e. by accepting the return of the advance payment has put an end to the contract, it matters not whether the sale consideration was settled at Rs.2,85,000 or 6,00,000. The question as to what was the actual sale consideration in such eventually looses its significance and is to be regarded as of no legal consequence.\n  40. There is also yet another aspect of the matter. Both in the legal notice dated 17-11-1974 as well as in plaint it is stated that plaintiff sent repeated reminders to the defendants to complete the transaction but the defendants failed and neglected to complete the transaction. Hence the plaintiff has taken only the plea that there was failure and neglect on the part of the defendants to complete the transaction. There is no plea in the plaint that the balance sale consideration was offered to the defendants which they refuse to accept. There is a vast difference between seller's failure to perform within the stipulated time and seller's refusal to receive the sale consideration upon it being offered by the buyer. In the evidence though, the plaintiff has attempted to establish that its representative took the balance sale consideration to the defendants within three-four days of the issuance of the receipt dated 4-11-1974 and the defendants refused to accept the same, but nowhere in the legal notice dated 17-12-1974 or in the plaint it has been stated by the plaintiff that it offered the amount to the defendants which they refused to accept. Had the offer of balance sale consideration been true, the plaintiff would have at least stated this in its legal notice dated 17-11-1974 or in the plaint. There is no such plea at all and has been taken for the first time in evidence. As the plea of refusal to accept the amount is not there in the plaintiff's pleadings, it cannot be considered as any attempt to establish such a plea in evidence would be allowing the plaintiff to travel beyond the scope of its pleadings. Even otherwise, no suggestion on this new plea taken at the evidence stage has been put to defendants' witness i.e. Osman Suleman (defendant No.1) when he appeared in the witness-box for his cross-examination. The effect of not taking such a plea in the plaint leads to the presumption that the event of offering the balance sale consideration never took place. Therefore, this plea of making an offer of balance sale consideration taken at the belated stage of recording of the evidence could only be regarded as an afterthought.\n  41. When admittedly the advance payment was returned back to the plaintiff on 9-11-1974, then in this background plaintiff's offer of balance sale consideration or defendants' refusal to accept the same at best would, be considered as a unilateral attempt to revive a dead contract, in case the offer was made after the return of the advance payment. On the other hand if the offer was made prior to the return of the advance payment, even then too the refusal on the part of the defendants would not help plaintiff's case as subsequently the plaintiff had itself received back the advance payment, thereby putting an end to an otherwise enforceable contract. Hence the refusal of the defendants, if at all there was any, is looked at from any angle, it becomes inconsequential as the plaintiff by receiving back the advance payment had itself put an end to the contract. Therefore, the trial Court rightly - dismissed plaintiff's suit for specific performance though in doing so, different reasons have been given. On the other hand the 1st Appellate Court failed to examine the oral and documentary evidence in its true perspective which resulted in the erroneous judgment resulting in miscarriage of justice and thus not sustainable in law.\n  42. I would now proceed to examine the question with regard to the maintainability of the suit. The trial Court it is decision has held that the suit was incompetently filed. In the grounds taken in the memo. of appeal this finding was only vaguely attacked by the plaintiff. Then the Appellate Court in its decision failed to give any finding on this issue.\n  43. The counsel for the plaintiff argued that Order XXIX, rule 1 of Civil Procedure Code by itself authorizes a Director to file suit on behalf the company and therefore, the suit was competently filed. The scope of Order XXIX, rule 1 of Civil Procedure Code is limited only to the signing and verification of the pleadings by certain named officers of a company or corporations who are able to depose to the facts of the case. This rule neither deals with the frame of the suit nor does it grant authority to these named officers to institute suit on behalf of a company or corporation. It is only an enabling provision and enable certain persons to sign and verify pleadings of a suit which should have otherwise been validly instituted under requisite authority of a company or corporation granted either by the Board of Directors or under the authority derived from Articles of Association.\n  44. Furthermore, as admittedly no resolution authorizing the Managing Director to institute the suit was produced in evidence, it is to be seen whether Articles of Association of the plaintiff-Company grants such authorization as has been argued by Mr. Khalid Anwar. In Article 30 of the plaintiff's Articles of Association it is stated that the affairs of the company are to be managed by its Directors. Article 31 authorizes the Directors to appoint any Director from amongst them to act as Managing Director in order to manage the affairs of the Company. Article 32 provides that the management of the plaintiff vests in its Board of Directors. The effect of these three articles when read together is that the affairs of the plaintiff are to be managed by a Managing Director to be appointed through the collective decision making process that is to take place before its Board of Directors. No Director in his individual capacity can manage the affairs of the plaintiff which under Article 32 exclusively vests with its Board.\n  45. Now the authority of the Managing Director to do any specific act such as to enter into a contract to purchase a property on behalf of the company or file suit to enforce a contract has to stem either from the decisions of the Board of Directors or from the Articles of Association itself. Where the Articles of Association do not specifically authorize the Managing Director to purchase or sell properties on behalf of the company, then in order for the Managing Director to exercise any power or do anything on behalf of the plaintiff, he has to have authorization from the plaintiff's Board of Directors. Articles of Association authorize the Managing Director only to run the business of the plaintiff-Company. They do not authorize him to invest plaintiff's capital in the purchase of the real estate or for arguments sake sell the properties of the company. If a Managing Director is given free hand to take such' major decisions without any authorization from the Board or under the Articles of Associations he can play havoc with company's assets and capital.\n  46. There also had to be specific authorization to the Managing Director either from the Board or under any Article of Articles of Association to file suit on behalf of the plaintiff-Company. In the present case, suit was filed by the plaintiff through its Managing Director. Now at the time of filing of the suit, did the Managing Director possess the authorization from the Board to do so, admittedly he did not. Now does any Article of the Articles of Association of the plaintiff-Company empowers the Managing Director to act on his own and file suit on behalf of the plaintiff, certainly not. In such circumstances, before a suit could be termed as competently filed, it was necessary that authorization in this regard must have come from plaintiff's Board of Directors. Thus, as held by the Honourable Supreme Court in the cases reported in Iftikhar Mamdot v. Ghulam Nabi Corp. PLD 1971 SC 550 the absence of authorization to file suit becomes fatal to the maintainability of the suit. In the present case, the suit being filed without proper authorization is to be treated as not maintainable and liable to be dismissed on this score alone.\n  47. In view of the above discussion, these appeals are allowed, the impugned judgment and decree, dated 23-12-2005 passed by the Additional District Judge is set aside and the judgment and decree, dated 29-4-2004 passed by the Civil Court, Malir in Suit No.339 of 1996 (Old Suit No.101 of 1975) is restored.\n  H.B.T./B-30/K Appeal allowed",

      "case_proceddings": "For convenience sakes, the appellants of these appeals, who are owners of 95 acres and were defendants in the suit, shall be described in this judgment as \"the defendants\" and the respondent, who was plaintiff in the suit shall be described as \"the plaintiff\".\n  4. The case of the plaintiff in the suit was that negotiations between Mr. Iqbal Suleman Goawala, the Managing Director of the plaintiff and Mr. Ahmed Dawood, the head of the Dawood family culminated in a deal for the sale of 95 acres of land at a price of Rs.3,000 per acre i.e. for Rs.285,000 for the entire 95 acres. Mr. Goawala paid an advance payment of Rs.100,000 to Mr. Ahmed Dawood through Cheque No.CBY447371 dated 31-10-1974. It was also the case of the plaintiff that transaction was agreed to be completed within 15 days. According to the plaintiff, this deal was struck with Mr. Ahmed Dawood after all other defendants who owned the land concurred with the transaction. The cheque dated 31-10-1974 for Rs.1,00,000 paid towards advance, was cleared by the bank on 4-11-1974 and upon such clearance, a receipt dated 4-1-1974 was issued to the plaintiff. It was also the case of the plaintiff that in spite of several reminders, when the defendants failed to complete the transaction within the stipulated period of 15 days, the plaintiff became suspicious, which led to serving of legal notice, dated 17-12-1974 on the defendants. In the notice, the plaintiff called upon the defendants to get the transaction completed within the next 15 days, failing which legal, action for seeking specific performance of the contract as well as for damages would be initiated.\n  5. The plaintiff's legal notice dated 17-12-1974 was replied by the defendants through their counsel's letter dated 31-12-1974. In the reply, the defendants disputed the sale consideration amount and claimed that it was settled atRs.6,00,000 and not Rs.2,85,000. It was also claimed in the reply that the balance sale consideration amount of Rs.5,00,000 was to be paid by the plaintiff within seven days from the date of the issuance of the cheque dated 31-10-1974 and as time was made the essence of the contract, hence according to the defendants, upon plaintiff's failure to make the payment by 7-11-1974, the contract came to an end and the advance amount in terms of the oral agreement was to be returned back to the plaintiff. In the defendants' reply dated 31-12-1974 it is clearly mentioned that Cheque 'bearing No.CBW 574892 dated 8-11-1974 for Rs.1,00,000 received as advance payment was returned under covering letter dated 8-11-1974 and handed over at the shop of the plaintiff on 9-11-1974.\n  6. On 24-2-1975 the plaintiff filed the suit for specific performance of the contract against the defendants wherein damages were also claimed in the alternative.\n  7. After going through the impugned judgment and the pleadings, basically following questions need to be examined by this Court.\n  (I) Whether the parties had reached a concluded contract and if yes on what terms and as it binding also on defendants Nos.3 namely Suleman Dawood?\n  (II) Which of the two contracting parties committed breach of the contract?\n  (III) Whether the contract came to an end upon plaintiff's receiving back the advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 that it paid to the defendants on 31-10-1974 i.e. at the time of finalizing the deal?\n  (IV) Whether the Managing Director of the plaintiff-Company was legally competent to file the suit?\n  8. Mr. Farogh Naseem and Mr. Abid S. Zuberi, appearing for the defendants in 2nd Appeals Nos.9 of 2006 and 31 of 2006 respectively argued that there was no concluded contract between the parties. They submitted that firstly the receipt dated 4-11-1974 does not disclose as to what was the sale consideration that was settled between the parties and secondly it does not mention the time within which the transaction was to be completed. They, therefore, argued that there was no concluded and binding contract between the parties and it was for this reason the receipt dated 4-11-1974 was described at \"Katcha receipt\". Apart from the argument that the receipt did not evince a concluded contract, they further argued that receipt was executed by a person who is not the exclusive owner of 95 acres of land and submitted that a person who himself does not hold proprietary interest or authority on behalf of other owners, cannot lawfully bind them with the contract that he entered into with the plaintiff, if at all there was any concluded contract. They further contended that the burden of proof to establish a binding and concluded contract was on the plaintiff-Company, which it failed to discharge and the relief of specific performance being discretionary ought not to have been granted by the 1st Appellate Court. In this regard they relied upon the cases reported in 1979 CLC 280 relevant pages 341 and 344.\n  9. The defendants' counsel next argued that Mr. Asif Iqbal, who was one of the Directors of the plaintiff-Company and appeared as its witness was only 14 years age at the time of the alleged transaction of sale and admittedly he was not even present at the time of negotiations. Therefore, they submitted that his statement is of no evidentiary value.\n  10. The defendants' counsel then argued that no Board Resolution was passed by the plaintiff-Company, authorizing its Managing Director to file suit against the defendants, therefore, in absence of authorization to file suit, it was not maintainable in law and liable to be dismissed on this score alone. They contended that the Minutes of Board Meetings that were produced by the plaintiff as Exh.6/14 nowhere make mention of the resolution authorizing its Managing Director to file the suit on behalf of the plaintiff-Company. They therefore, submitted that the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside and the judgment and decree passed by the Civil Court whereby the suit was dismissed may be restored.\n  11. Mr. Mushtaq A. Memon, who appeared in 2nd Appeal No.9 of 2006 on behalf of the plaintiff argued that when the receipt dated 4-11-1974 is read with the contents of the defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974, it becomes quite apparent that a binding contract having all the ingredients of a concluded contract came into existence. He, further submitted that defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974 is duly acknowledged and owned by the defendants in their written statements while making rely to paragraphs 6 to 17 of the plaint and therefore, the only controversy that remained to tie decided was as to what was the, actual sale consideration settled between the parties i.e. whether it was 2,85,000 or 6,00,000 and this can be ascertained by appreciating the evidence that has come on the record of the case. He then submitted that evidence clearly establishes that fact that the sale consideration was settled at Rs.3,000 per acre i.e. Rs.285,000 for the entire lot of 95 acres and not Rs.6,00,000 as claimed by the defendants. With regard to the defendants' argument that the receipt, dated 4-11-1974 was not a binding and concluded contract, Mr. Mushtaq A. Memon relied upon the cases reported in 2004 MLD 1778 and 2005 MLD 1745 at page 1748 in order to show that receipt by itself can be termed as contract if it has all the, ingredients of a concluded contract.\n  12. Mr. Mushtaq A. Memon also argued that the defendants during the pendency of the suit sought certain amendments to the written statements which were allowed subject to all just exceptions but this permission does not mean that under its garb the defendants can improve upon their case. He submitted that law does not permit a party to improve upon its case and deviate from its original pleadings as in proving ones case a party has to confine its case to its original pleadings. He, therefore, submitted that any evidence that was led by the defendants beyond the original pleadings is not to be looked into.\n  13. Mr. Mushtaq A. Memon next argued that those defendants who have filed their separate written statements ought to have produced their witnesses and failure to do so means that they have no defence to offer. In support of this contention, he relied upon the cases reported in PLD 1970 SC 25, PLD 1975 SC 598, PLD 1977 SC 109 at page 133, 1979 CLC 338, 2003 MLD 205 at page 209, 2008 CLD 85 at page 91.\n  14. This is not a case where no one has appeared as witness on behalf of the defendants. Defendant No.4 appears as his own witness but due to his advance age and mental incapacity he was unable to continue with his deposition. On behalf of rest of the defendants, defendant No.1 appeared as witness. Where there is common cause or common defence then it is not necessary that each of the defendants should appear to defend their stand. Any of them can appear as witness.\n  15. In reply to the defendants' argument that suit was not competently filed, Mr. Mushtaq A. Memon referred to the provisions of Order XXIX, rule 1 of Civil Procedure Code and relied upon the cases reported in 2003 SCMR 318, 1996 CLC 1064 at page 1067, 2003 CLD 1497 at page 1503, AIR 1937 Nag. 379, PLD 190 Lah. 208 at page 210 and contented that suit was competently filed.\n  16. Mr. Khalid Anwar; who appeared for the plaintiff in Appeal No.31 of 2006 argued that in the second appeal filed under section 100, C.P.C. the question of fact are not to be gone into and only questions of law are to be examined. He argued that the defendants in their respective written statements have owned the contents of the letter, dated 31-12-1974, wherein the contract has been admitted and the only dispute was raised in the letter dated 31-12-1974 was that the sale consideration was settled at Rs.6,00,000 and not Rs.2,85,000. He argued that the issue with regard to the actual sale consideration has already been decided by the 1st Appellate Court on the basis of evidence on record and therefore, this question of fact cannot be gone into in this 2nd appeal. Mr. Khalid Anwar further argued that the defendants in support of the averments made in the written statements have not led any evidence to establish that the sale consideration was Rs.6,00,000 and the version of the plaintiff that the sale consideration was settled at Rs.2,85,000 having gone unchallenged, the same would not be open to question in 2nd appeal. He supported this argument by submitting that when the plaintiff's witness P. W.1 deposed in his cross-examination that the sale consideration was Rs.2,85,000 i.e. Rs.3,000 per acre, no question was put to him in cross-examination. He submitted that when a party is not cross-examined on any point then such point is deemed to have been admitted by the other party.\n  17. Mr. Khalid Anwar next argued that absence of Board Resolution was not fatal to plaintiff's as Article 31 of the Articles of Association of the plaintiff-Company duly authorizes its Board to appoint any Director to act as its Managing Director for a period of three years and Article 30 authorizes the Managing Director to run the affairs of the plaintiff-Company. He therefore, submitted that on account of authorization contained in Articles 30 and 31 of the Articles of Association, there was no need for any resolution from the Board in order to authorize its Managing Director to file suit. He placed reliance on the eases reported in 1996 CLC 1064 at pages 1067, 2003 CLD 1497 at page 1053, 2004 MLD 1778 at page 1780, 2008 CLC 727 at page 730, Muhammad Siddiq v. Australiasia Bank Ltd. PLD 1966 SC 684 at page 1067, Iftikhar Mamdot v. Ghulam Nabi Corp. PLD 1971 SC 550, Central Bank of India v. Taj-ud-Din Abdur Rauf 1992 SCMR 846 and Pemco International v. Hubei Machinery Corp. 2005 CLD 74.\n  18. Mr. Khalid Anwar lastly argued that all the defendants have not preferred second appeal against the judgment passed by the Appellate Court and, therefore, insofar as their cases are concerned, the impugned judgment has attained finality against them and is not open to challenge.\n  19. Mr. Farogh Naseem, who appears in Appeal No.9 of 2006 for defendant No.3, in reply submitted that defendant No.4 never owned the transaction in his written statement which he filed separately and therefore, insofar as the land belonging to defendant No.4 is concerned, there was no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the said defendants.\n  20. Mr. Farogh Naseem and Mr. Abid Zubairi also contended that none of the Articles of Association authorize its Managing Director to file suit on behalf of the company, therefore, the case-law referred to by plaintiff's counsel is of no help to the plaintiffs' case. They submitted that as Article 30 or 31 of the Articles of Association, nowhere give authorization to anyone to file suit on behalf of the plaintiff-Company, therefore, it was necessary that Board should have passed resolution, without which the suit was incompetent in law and liable to be dismissed.\n  They submitted that the First Appellate Court committed error by totally ignoring this aspect of the case and did not give any findings on the maintainability of the suit.\n  21. In reply to Mr. Khalid Anwar's argument that under section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code, a Court hearing 2nd appeal cannot examine the questions of fact and only questions of law are to be examined, Mr. Abid S. Zuberi, contended that the construction of documents is always a question of law and not of fact and therefore, this Court in second appeal can examine the documents and interpret their true meaning and import in order to resolve the controversy. He relied upon the cases reported in PLD 1974 SC 204, 1996 CLC 1616; 1986 MLD 206; 1985 PLC 1321 and PLD 1966 Dacca 486. In the case of Gulzar Khan v. Shahzad Bibi reported in PLD 1974 SC 204 it was held by the Honourable Supreme Court that proper construction of a document is a question of law and not of fact. Hence in my view the interpretation of documents around which whole transaction in question revolves is nothing but to decide a question of law in terms of the ratio of the above referred judgment of the Supreme Court. In the, case of Ahmad Khan v. Rasul Shah and others reported in PLD 1975 SC 311 it was held that right construction of documents has always been regarded as question of law which the High Court is not precluded from considering in second appeal. There has been a flood of case-law in support of this proposition. In the case of Gulzar Khan v. Mst. Shahzada Bibi and others reported in PLD 1974 SC 204, it was held as under:--\n  \"While it is undoubtedly correct that an inference drawn from evidence amounts to a finding of fact, yet it is well-settled that the question of the proper construction of document is a question of law and not of fact. In the present case, the question turns solely on the construction of the documents by which the transaction was evidenced and therefore, the High Court was right in regarding this as a question of law and giving its own interpretation, an interpretation with which we agree.\"\n  22. With regard to the argument that some of the defendants have not filed their own appeals, Mr. Abid Zubairi contended that under Order XLI, rule 32 of Civil Procedure Code the Court can grant the relief to a respondent who has not preferred appeal. He relied upon cases reported in PLD 1965 SC 15 and PLD 1992 SC 590.\n  23. Mr. Khalid Anwar, learned counsel in response to the arguments of Mr. Abid S. Zuberi in respect to applicability of Order XLI, rule 32 has placed reliance on the cases reported in Hasan Muhammad v. Jan Muhammad PLD 1982 Lah. 132, Shah Muhammad V. Muhammad Baksh PLD 372 SC 321, Kanwal Nain v. Fateh Khan PLD 1983 SC 53, 1996 SCMR 1862, PLD 1973 SC 295 and AIR 1927 Born. 128 and submitted that no such relief can be granted.\n  24. The contents of the plaint and the contents of the written statements are basically the reflection of the stands which the plaintiff and the defendants have respectively taken with regard to the transaction in question in the legal notice dated 17-12-1974 and its reply dated 31-12-1974. The only exception is that defendant No.4 i.e. Mr. Suleman Dawood in his written statement has taken the plea that he neither gave his consent nor authorized anyone to enter into any sale transaction in relation to his 10 acres out of disputed 95 acres of land and unlike other defendants he did not own the contents of the letter, dated 31-12-1974 that was sent on behalf of the defendants in reply to plaintiff's legal notice, dated 17-12-1974.\n  25. After the disclosure of the respective positions of the parties in their pleadings, no evidence which deviates from or is contrary to the pleadings is to be looked into. Rights and obligations of the respective parties are always to be determined keeping in view only such pleas that have been taken by them in their respective pleadings. The evidence that is adduced by the parties is also to be looked into only to the extent it supports or opposes the pleas that have been taken by the parties in their pleadings. Any piece of evidence which is beyond the scope of the pleadings cannot be considered while deciding a controversy. This is a well-established legal principle. A Division Bench of this Court in the case of Ehteshamuddin Qureshi v. Pakistan Steel Mills reported in 2004 MLD 36. held that a party cannot be allowed to lead evidence contrary to its pleadings nor could a party be permitted to take a plea different than the plea which it has taken in its pleadings and any part of the evidence which is beyond the pleadings is ought to be overlooked as improvement of the nature being afterthought and impermissible in law.\n  26. I would now examine the argument that failure to adduce evidence is fatal to ones case. A plaintiff has to adduce evidence in support of his pleas that he has taken in his plaint. However, no evidence is required to establish a plea which is either admitted or remained uncontroverted by the defendant in his written statement. Similarly, unless a plea which a defendant has taken in his written statement is admitted or has not been controverted by the plaintiff in his evidence, then too, applying the same principle, requires no evidence from the defendant to prove such a plea. Adducing evidence is not a legal requirement which is to be fulfilled in' every eventuality. Evidence is required to be adduced by a party, be it a plaintiff or defendant, only to establish disputed questions so that the Court is able to resolve conflicting claims. Where record of the case reflect that a party's plea has either been admitted or has remained uncontroverted by the other side, either in its pleadings or in the evidence, then adducing evidence to establish an admitted or uncontroverted plea would obviously be an exercise in futility.\n  27. A closer examination of the pleas that have been taken in the plaint and the written statements by the respective parties show that the controversy with regard to the disputed transaction basically revolves around four documents. The first of these documents is receipt dated 4-11-1974 (Exh.5/1). The second document is letter dated 8-11-1974 written by Osman Suleman on behalf of the defendants to the plaintiff. The third document is plaintiff's legal notice dated 17-12-1974 (Exh.6/12) and the fourth is reply dated 31-12-1974 (Exh.6/13) that was made to plaintiff's legal notice dated 17-12-1974. The second of these four documents i.e. defendants' letter dated 8-11-1974 to the plaintiff though was never produced in evidence but its contents have been reproduced by the defendants in Exh.6/13.\n  28. The first document is the receipt dated 4-11-1974 that was executed by Mr. Osman Suienian on behalf of the defendants acknowledges the receipt of advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 which the plaintiff paid through a cheque dated 31-10-1974. In the receipt dated 4-11-1974, neither the sale consideration nor the time for completion of the transaction is mentioned.\n  29. The second document is defendants' letter dated 8-11-1974 with which defendant enclosed Cheque No.CBW574892 dated 8-11-1974 for Rs.1,00,000 towards the return of the advance amount received by them at the time of entering into the transaction. The defendants delivered this letter along with the cheque to the plaintiff on 9-11-1974. This letter dated 8-11-1974 that was delivered to the plaintiff though was not produced in evidence by the plaintiff but its contents have been reproduced by the defendants in this letter dated 31-12-1974 that was produced in evidence as Exh.6/13. In the letter dated 8-11-1974, the defendant while addressing the plaintiff have stated the circumstances in which the advance payment was being returned. The defendants state \"Please find enclosed a Cheque No.CBW574892, dated 8-11-1974 for Rs.1,00,000 which you had given to us in respect of sale of land. Since you have not fulfilled the conditions of sale we had agreed upon this amount is being returned to you\". It is surprising to note that the advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 was received back by the plaintiff on 9-11-1974 yet in its legal notice dated 17-12-1974 as well as in the plaint the factum of receiving- back the advance payment has not been mentioned. The contents of letter, dated 8-11-1974, which were reproduced in defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974 (Exh.6/13) were not denied by the plaintiff in its evidence. The return of the advance amount back from the defendants was also admitted by plaintiff's witness Haji Sharif during his cross-examination. If at all there was any plausible justification for the plaintiff to receive back the advance payment and yet maintain its right to seek enforcement of the, contract some explanation' ought to have been given by the plaintiff in its evidence but there is none.\n  30. The third document is the legal notice, dated 17-12-1974 that was sent by the plaintiff to the defendants through Osman Suleman. In this document it is stated that all defendants of 95 acres had agreed to sell the land at the rate of Rs.3,000 per acre and as the defendants failed to complete the transaction within 15 days as agreed between the parties, they should complete the same within 15 days failing which legal action would be taken.\n  31. The fourth document is letter dated 31-12-1974 sent on behalf of the defendants in reply to plaintiff's legal notice dated 17-12-1974. In the said reply it was claimed that the total sale consideration was settled at Rs.6,00,000 and not Rs.2,85,000 and the balance sale consideration of Rs.5,00,000 was payable within one week of the issuance of the cheque for advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 i.e. one week from 31-10-1974. It was also claimed in this letter that as the plaintiff failed to complete the transaction by 7-11-1974, the advance payment was, returned to it vide Cheque No.CBW 574892 dated 8-11-1974 with covering letter dated 8-11-1974 that was delivered to the plaintiff at his shop on 9-11-1974. As stated earlier, the contents of the covering letter dated 8-11-1974 are reproduced in the reply dated 31-12-1974 have never been denied in any manner by the plaintiff at any stage of the proceedings.\n  32. Now the first document i.e. receipt dated 4-11-1974 is not executed by all the defendants nor it was established in evidence that Mr. Osman Suleman who executed the receipt and made reply to plaintiff's legal notice dated 17-12-1974 was holding any written authority on defendants' behalf to enter into sale transaction with the plaintiff. Except for defendant No.4 i.e. Mr. Suleman Dawood, the contents of the reply dated 31-12-1974, that was made to plaintiff's legal notice dated 17-12-1974, have been acknowledged and owned by all the defendants in their written statements. When the contents of the receipt dated 4-11-1974 are read with the contents of the fourth document i.e. letter dated 31-12-1974, it becomes quite apparent that undoubtedly parties had entered into a contract and its existence has been acknowledged by all such defendants who have owned and adopted the contents of the letter dated 31-12-1974 in their written statements. Therefore, it cannot be said that there was no concluded contract between the parties and the contentions of the defendants counsel in this regard have no force. Only defendant No.4, Mr. Suleman Dawood has totally denied that he gave any concurrence or authorization to enter into any such transaction in relation to the land owned by him and therefore, to the extent of his land only it can be said that contract was not binding on him.\n  33. The absence of time for the performance of the contract in the receipt dated 4-11-1974 is also of no legal consequence for the reason that when time for the performance of a contract is not specified, it has to be performed within a reasonable time. Section 46 of the Contract Act provides for such eventuality. Therefore, even if parties have not specified any time for the performance of a contract, the same does not make it unenforceable in law. A Court can read into such contracts a time which it deems reasonable for its performance, keeping in view the circumstances of each contract. However, in order to find out as to which of the two parties were at fault in the performance of contract keeping in view their respective pleadings as to the time for performance, it is necessary to first examine the evidence on record. I shall therefore, proceed to examine the question as to what was the time that was settled for the performance of the contract.\n  34. The cheque for the advance payment is dated 31-10-1974 and in terms of defendants letter dated 8-11-1974, the transaction was to be completed by 7-11-1974 i.e. within one week from the issuance of the cheque dated 31-10-1974. In defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974 it is stated that time was made' the essence of the contract and upon failure to make payment within stipulated time, the advance amount was to be returned back to the plaintiff. Hence, according to defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974, the time for completing the transaction ended on 7-11-1974 and as by then the plaintiff did not make payment of the balance sale consideration, the contract stood terminated and for this reason defendants returned the advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 back to the plaintiff on 9-11-1974. All these assertions are contained in the defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974 that was produced in evidence as Exh.6/13. Hence it has undisputedly come on record that the defendants returned the advance payment through a cheque dated 8-11-1974 which was delivered to the plaintiff on 9-11-1974 i.e. on the 9th day of entering into the contract and the plaintiff on its part accepted the return of the same without any objection. This return of the advance payment and its acceptance by the plaintiff appears to be quite in consonance with the stand taken by the defendants in their letter dated 31-12-1974 and shows that the parties had agreed to complete the transaction within a very short period of time otherwise there was no occasion for the plaintiff to receive back the advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 on 9-11-1974 i.e. on the ninth day of striking the deal for the purchase of the land without any protest.\n  35. The fact that the transaction was to be completed within seven days from the issuance of the cheque dated 31-10-1974 or in other words by 7-11-1974 is also established from the fact that plaintiff's own witness Mr. Sharif in his cross-examination has stated that when he .gave the receipt dated 4-11-1974 to Mr. Goawala, he pointed out that neither the price of the land nor the balance sale consideration is mentioned in the receipt to which the witness replied that as the transaction would be completed within two-three days, Mr. Goawala should not be worried about such omissions. The statement of plaintiff's witness at least goes to show that when the receipt was delivered there were only two-three left for the completion of the transaction. When seven days for the completion of the transaction, as claimed by the defendants, are counted from the date of tendering the cheque for advance payment i.e. 31-10-1974, or the two-three days, as stated by plaintiff's witness Mr. Sharif, are counted from the date of the issuance of the receipt dated 4-11-1974, the time for completion of the transaction invariably comes to 7-11-1974. This was precisely the case of the defendants in their letter dated 31-12-1974 as well as in their written statements. On the other hand, the plaintiff in the plaint has taken the plea that the transaction was to be completed within fifteen days i.e. day 15-11-1974. If that was so the why the plaintiff received back the advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 from the defendants on 9-11-1974 i.e. on the ninth day of the transaction and that too without any protest. If at all there was any justification for receiving back the advance payment before the time for completion of the transaction has expired then the plaintiff should have stated so and explained his position at any subsequent stage. However, for unknown reasons, the plaintiff in its legal notice dated 17-12-1974 made no mention of the defendants' letter dated 8-11-1974 or of the cheque that was enclosed with it. When the return of the advance payment and its acceptance by the plaintiff without any objection on 9-11-1974 is taken into consideration, it becomes absolutely clear that the plaintiff accepted the return of the advance payment on the ninth day of entering upon the contract only for the reason that it was unable to complete the transaction before the return of the advance payment and the time for performance was certainly before the return of the advance payment. No other conclusion could be drawn when the plaintiff itself choose not to give any explanation of its own in its pleadings or even in its evidence for the examination of the Court.\n  36. The return of advance payment and its acceptance by the _ plaintiff on 9-11-1974 has also establishes another plea of the defendants that it was also agreed between the parties that in case of plaintiff's failure to complete the transaction by 7-11-1974, the advance payment E was to be returned back to the plaintiff. The defendants' letter dated 31-12-1974 contains reference to defendant's earlier letter dated 8-11-1974. In fact the contents of letter, dated 8-11-1974 have been reproduced in letter dated 31-12-1974. In the letter dated 8-11-1974, the circumstances in which the advance payment was returned are clearly mentioned. The defendants in the letter dated 8-11-1974 while addressing the plaintiff has stated \"please find enclosed a Cheque No.CBW 574892, dated 8-11-1974 for Rs.1,00,000 which you had given to us in respect of sale of land. Since you have not fulfilled the conditions of sale we had agreed upon, this amount is being returned to you\". There is absolutely no denial of the contents of the letter, dated 8-11-1974. hence there is absolutely no reason not to believe its contents. The cumulative effect of the return of the advance amount on the ninth day of entering into the contract and its acceptance by the plaintiff without any protest is that the parties from their own conduct demonstrated that they intended to terminate the contract.\n37. Where a purchaser accepts the return of the earnest money without any protest, then this fact by itself amounts to putting an end to the contract, irrespective of the fact that the time fixed between the parties for the performance of the contract has expired or not. The plaintiff, therefore, by receiving back the advance amount, had in fact given up all his rights that he possessed under the contract. Such being the position emerging from the contract of the plaintiff itself, it matters not whether time was the essence of the contract or what was the actual sale consideration that was settled between the parties. The plaintiff from its own conduct of accepting the return of the advance payment has amply demonstrated that whatever were the terms of the contract, it has put an end to it on 9-11-1974.\n  38. Even in contracts where time is not of the essence, the purchaser has to demonstrate that at all material times he was ready and willing to perform his part of the contract. I have also noticed that the plaintiff's witness Mr. Ismail in his deposition has stated that after four-five days of reaching the contract, 'Mr. Ahmed Dawood demanded from Mr. Goawala the balance sale consideration and when the said witness took the amount of Rs.2,00,000 from Mr. Goawala and offered the same to Mr. Ahmed Dawood he refused to accept the same and thereafter parties exchanged legal notices. This witness i.e. Mr. Ismail does not say what was the reason given by Mr. Ahmed Dawood for not accepting the balance sale consideration when according to this witness, the demand for payment of the balance sale consideration came from Mr. Ahmed Dawood himself. If Mr. Ahmed Dawood, after making demand refused to accept the same only because he demanded more than what was agreed upon, ten plaintiff's witness ought to have stated so in his deposition, which he has not. On the other hand if Mr. Ahmed Dawood never demanded more than the agreed sale consideration, then why would he refuse to receive the balance sale consideration offered to him just after four-five days of entering into the contract when he had himself demanded the same to be paid to him. The only reasons one can think of is that the plaintiff failed to offer the balance sale consideration with in the time stipulated for the performance of the contract. When such refusal, if there was any, is looked at in the context of defendants' plea that the transaction was to be completed by 7-11-1974, it proves the fact that defendants' refusal was on account of plaintiff's failure to offer the balance sale consideration within seven days entering into the contract. It also demonstrated that the plaintiff was not ready and willing to complete the transaction within the stipulated seven days. Not only this, the plaintiff on its part then accepted the return of the earnest money which he paid to the defendants as advance payment. This too clearly demonstrated that it was no more willing to get the transaction completed and was agreeable to put an end to it by accepting the turn of the advance payment. In order to retain its right to see enforcement of the contract, the plaintiff ought to have demonstrated that he was ready and willing to perform its part of the contract at all material times and should not have received back, the advance payment. After accepting the return of the advance amount, nothing was left' to be enforced. Thus, the contract simply stood terminated by the conduct of both the parties which appears to be the mutual intent at the relevant time.\n  39. With regard to the dispute as to what was the actual sale consideration, the plaintiff claimed that the sale consideration was settled at Rs.2,85,000. The defendants on their part claimed that sale consideration was Rs.6,00,000. Though the sale consideration is not mentioned in the receipt dated 4-11-1974, one thing is clear. At the time of making advance payment of Rs.1,00,000 the parties had agreed to a certain definite price. If the price was to be determined at some subsequent stage after making the advance payment, then the defendants ought to have taken such plea in their letter, dated 31-12-1974 or in their written statements. But they have not pleaded so. Therefore, it is clear that price was settled but for some reason it was not mentioned in the receipt. In any case, as the plaintiff, from his own conduct i.e. by accepting the return of the advance payment has put an end to the contract, it matters not whether the sale consideration was settled at Rs.2,85,000 or 6,00,000. The question as to what was the actual sale consideration in such eventually looses its significance and is to be regarded as of no legal consequence.\n  40. There is also yet another aspect of the matter. Both in the legal notice dated 17-11-1974 as well as in plaint it is stated that plaintiff sent repeated reminders to the defendants to complete the transaction but the defendants failed and neglected to complete the transaction. Hence the plaintiff has taken only the plea that there was failure and neglect on the part of the defendants to complete the transaction. There is no plea in the plaint that the balance sale consideration was offered to the defendants which they refuse to accept. There is a vast difference between seller's failure to perform within the stipulated time and seller's refusal to receive the sale consideration upon it being offered by the buyer. In the evidence though, the plaintiff has attempted to establish that its representative took the balance sale consideration to the defendants within three-four days of the issuance of the receipt dated 4-11-1974 and the defendants refused to accept the same, but nowhere in the legal notice dated 17-12-1974 or in the plaint it has been stated by the plaintiff that it offered the amount to the defendants which they refused to accept. Had the offer of balance sale consideration been true, the plaintiff would have at least stated this in its legal notice dated 17-11-1974 or in the plaint. There is no such plea at all and has been taken for the first time in evidence. As the plea of refusal to accept the amount is not there in the plaintiff's pleadings, it cannot be considered as any attempt to establish such a plea in evidence would be allowing the plaintiff to travel beyond the scope of its pleadings. Even otherwise, no suggestion on this new plea taken at the evidence stage has been put to defendants' witness i.e. Osman Suleman (defendant No.1) when he appeared in the witness-box for his cross-examination. The effect of not taking such a plea in the plaint leads to the presumption that the event of offering the balance sale consideration never took place. Therefore, this plea of making an offer of balance sale consideration taken at the belated stage of recording of the evidence could only be regarded as an afterthought.\n  41. When admittedly the advance payment was returned back to the plaintiff on 9-11-1974, then in this background plaintiff's offer of balance sale consideration or defendants' refusal to accept the same at best would, be considered as a unilateral attempt to revive a dead contract, in case the offer was made after the return of the advance payment. On the other hand if the offer was made prior to the return of the advance payment, even then too the refusal on the part of the defendants would not help plaintiff's case as subsequently the plaintiff had itself received back the advance payment, thereby putting an end to an otherwise enforceable contract. Hence the refusal of the defendants, if at all there was any, is looked at from any angle, it becomes inconsequential as the plaintiff by receiving back the advance payment had itself put an end to the contract. Therefore, the trial Court rightly - dismissed plaintiff's suit for specific performance though in doing so, different reasons have been given. On the other hand the 1st Appellate Court failed to examine the oral and documentary evidence in its true perspective which resulted in the erroneous judgment resulting in miscarriage of justice and thus not sustainable in law.\n  42. I would now proceed to examine the question with regard to the maintainability of the suit. The trial Court it is decision has held that the suit was incompetently filed. In the grounds taken in the memo. of appeal this finding was only vaguely attacked by the plaintiff. Then the Appellate Court in its decision failed to give any finding on this issue.\n  43. The counsel for the plaintiff argued that Order XXIX, rule 1 of Civil Procedure Code by itself authorizes a Director to file suit on behalf the company and therefore, the suit was competently filed. The scope of Order XXIX, rule 1 of Civil Procedure Code is limited only to the signing and verification of the pleadings by certain named officers of a company or corporations who are able to depose to the facts of the case. This rule neither deals with the frame of the suit nor does it grant authority to these named officers to institute suit on behalf of a company or corporation. It is only an enabling provision and enable certain persons to sign and verify pleadings of a suit which should have otherwise been validly instituted under requisite authority of a company or corporation granted either by the Board of Directors or under the authority derived from Articles of Association.\n  44. Furthermore, as admittedly no resolution authorizing the Managing Director to institute the suit was produced in evidence, it is to be seen whether Articles of Association of the plaintiff-Company grants such authorization as has been argued by Mr. Khalid Anwar. In Article 30 of the plaintiff's Articles of Association it is stated that the affairs of the company are to be managed by its Directors. Article 31 authorizes the Directors to appoint any Director from amongst them to act as Managing Director in order to manage the affairs of the Company. Article 32 provides that the management of the plaintiff vests in its Board of Directors. The effect of these three articles when read together is that the affairs of the plaintiff are to be managed by a Managing Director to be appointed through the collective decision making process that is to take place before its Board of Directors. No Director in his individual capacity can manage the affairs of the plaintiff which under Article 32 exclusively vests with its Board.\n  45. Now the authority of the Managing Director to do any specific act such as to enter into a contract to purchase a property on behalf of the company or file suit to enforce a contract has to stem either from the decisions of the Board of Directors or from the Articles of Association itself. Where the Articles of Association do not specifically authorize the Managing Director to purchase or sell properties on behalf of the company, then in order for the Managing Director to exercise any power or do anything on behalf of the plaintiff, he has to have authorization from the plaintiff's Board of Directors. Articles of Association authorize the Managing Director only to run the business of the plaintiff-Company. They do not authorize him to invest plaintiff's capital in the purchase of the real estate or for arguments sake sell the properties of the company. If a Managing Director is given free hand to take such' major decisions without any authorization from the Board or under the Articles of Associations he can play havoc with company's assets and capital.\n  46. There also had to be specific authorization to the Managing Director either from the Board or under any Article of Articles of Association to file suit on behalf of the plaintiff-Company. In the present case, suit was filed by the plaintiff through its Managing Director. Now at the time of filing of the suit, did the Managing Director possess the authorization from the Board to do so, admittedly he did not. Now does any Article of the Articles of Association of the plaintiff-Company empowers the Managing Director to act on his own and file suit on behalf of the plaintiff, certainly not. In such circumstances, before a suit could be termed as competently filed, it was necessary that authorization in this regard must have come from plaintiff's Board of Directors. Thus, as held by the Honourable Supreme Court in the cases reported in Iftikhar Mamdot v. Ghulam Nabi Corp. PLD 1971 SC 550 the absence of authorization to file suit becomes fatal to the maintainability of the suit. In the present case, the suit being filed without proper authorization is to be treated as not maintainable and liable to be dismissed on this score alone.",

The distinguishing facts are as follows:---\n  (i) In the matter of Civil Revision No.2071 the respondent vide Mutation of Exchange No.1120 acquired land measuring 33 Kanals, 8 Marlas. The case of the petitioner was that he had in fact purchased the land for Rs.2,50,000.\n  (ii) In the matter of Civil Revision No.2072 of 2007 vide Exchange Mutation No.1123 attested on 22-3-2003 the respondent acquired land measuring 8 Kanals, 11 Marlas. The case of the petitioner was that he purchased the land for Rs.80,000.\n  Both the suits were filed on 21-7-2003. The petitioner claimed to be a Shafi-e-Shareek, Khalit and Jar. The performance of Talbs was pleaded in both the cases. The -respondent filed written statements insisting that he has acquired the land by exchange and denied the other allegations. Following issues were framed in the said cases:---\n  1. Whether the plaintiff made valid Talbs as required by law? OPP\n  2. Whether the plaintiff has got superior right of pre-emption qua the defendant? OPP\n  3. Whether transaction was sale against consideration of Rs.2,50,000 (Rs.80,000 in the other case) and that it was shaped as exchange just to avoid pre-emption right of plaintiff? OPP\n  4. Whether the plaintiff has got no cause of action? OPD\n  5. Whether the suit is undervalued for purpose of court-fees? OPD\n  6. Whether the defendant is entitled to special costs? OPD\n  7. Relief.\n  Evidence of the parties was recorded. Under issue No.2 the learned trial Court found that the petitioner has a superior right of pre-emption being co-sharer. Under issue No.3 the transaction was found to be an exchange while under issue No.1 it was found that the petitioner had failed to prove Talb-e-Muwathibat. Issues Nos.4 and 6 were answered against the respondent. The, petitioner filed first appeal. A learned Additional District Judge, Hafizabad, did not address himself to the question of Talb-e-Muwathibat at all. The matter of Talb-e-Ishhad was also discussed a bit but not concluded. However, findings in the matter of nature of transaction were affirmed. The appeals were dismissed on 20-7-2007.\n  3. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that both the learned Courts below have misread rather failed to read evidence on record while dealing with the nature of the transaction. It is apparent on the face of record that exchange was a disguise. According to him the land allegedly given in exchange ultimately came to the wife of the respondent. He also questions the findings of the learned Courts below in the matter of Talbs. Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, contends that in the absence of any evidence that consideration was paid other circumstances would be of no avail in the matter of determining the nature of transaction. He, however, agrees that the matter of Talb has not been duly adjudicated upon by the learned Additional District Judge.\n  4. I have gone through the copies of the records appended with le these civil revisions, with the assistance of the learned counsel for the parties. In both the plaints it was categorically stated that it was sale for a consideration and exchange is fictitious. The possession never changed hands. The respondent, on the other hand, asserted that it was a bona fide exchange. Evidence was led by the petitioner. Muhammad Mansha, petitioner appeared as P.W.3 in both the cases and stated that the possession of the land allegedly given in exchange remained with respondent and he got it transferred back in the name of Sana Ullah the husband of his sister. Rana Shahbaz Khan, P.W.4 made a similar statement and stated that the land was first got transferred in favour of Sana Ullah and now is in the name of wife of .the respondent. To the similar effect is statement of Muhammad Afzal, P.W.5. Although in cross-examination it was suggested to these witnesses and they have admitted that no consideration changed hands in their presence. However, the remaining averments were not questioned at all. In rebuttal the respondent appeared as D.W.1. He admitted that Sana Ullah is the son of maternal uncle as also the husband of his sister. When confronted he stated that he does not know that the land was transferred back first to Sana Ullah and then to his wife. The transfer in favour of Sana Ullah is evidenced by registered sale-deed Exh.P.9 in both the cases while in favour of Mst. Hameedan Begum wife of the respondent by means of mutation Exh. P.10 in both the cases.\n  5. Learned counsel for the respondent contends that a large area was transferred back after considerable period of time and as such the same would not derogate from the factum of exchange. It is true that mutations of exchange were attested on 22-3-2003 while the land was transferred in favour of Sana Ullah vide Exh.P.9 dated 28-4-2004 and then in the name of wife of the respondent vide mutation Exh. P.10 attested on 7-2-2006. However, as noted by me there are some specific B pleadings and then evidence was led and the respondent appeared in the witness box after the said evidence had been recorded. He did not offer any explanation as to how the land ultimately came back to his wife. On the other hand, he simply expressed ignorance which is not sufficient rebuttal of the said oral as well as documentary evidence. Similarly in the matter of possession neither the P.Ws. were cross-examined nor any rebuttal was led. In the case of Mst. Miraj Bibi v. Mst. Azim Khatoon and others 1997 SCMR 1892 it was held by the Honourable Supreme Court that to prove passing of consideration in cash in the case of sale disguised as exchange is not absolute rule and it was further held that to prove distinction between device and disguise evidence led by the parties including circumstantial has to be looked into.\n  6. The impugned judgments are completely silent vis-a-vis the said significant aspect of the matter, which remained totally unexplained by the respondent. I, therefore, do hold that the transaction is of a sale and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary sale price is one mentioned in the plaint as also in the evidence. The findings of the learned lower Courts on issue No.3 in both the cases are accordingly reversed and issue is answered in the affirmative.\n  7. Finding regarding superior right of pre-emption was not challenged in the course of hearing of first appeals neither in these civil revision, the same is accordingly affirmed. This leaves issue No.1 pertaining to Talbs, both the learned counsel are agreed that the learned appellate Court did not properly adjudicate upon the said aspect of the matter. Both the civil revisions are accordingly allowed. The result would be that the first appeals filed by the petitioner shall be deemed to be pending. The parties shall appear before the learned District Judge, Hafizabad, who will requisition the record and proceed further himself or entrust the cases to a learned Additional District Judge, who shall hear the parties, examine evidence on record and decide issue No.1 pertaining to Talbs afresh in accordance with law. In case issue No.1 is found in favour of the petitioner the decree shall be passed-in both the cases with requisite direction and in case it is answered against the petitioner the suits shall be dismissed. No order as to costs.\n  A copy of this judgment is immediately remitted to the learned District Judge, Hafizabad.\n  S.A.K./M-516/L Case remanded.",

Tariq for Petitioner.\n  Muhammad Aqil for Respondent No.1.\n  Date of hearing: 15th October, 2009.\n    JUDGMENT\n  SHAHID ANWAR BAJWA, J.--- Brief facts giving rise to this Constitutional petition are that petitioner is tenant in respect of Flat No.B-21 Second Floor Sunny Heights constructed on Sub-plot No.118/.3/H-5, of Plot No.118/3 at Deh Odewari, Main Rashid Minhas Road. Tenancy commenced on 6-1-2003. Ejectment Application No.183 of 2007 was filed on 31-3-2007 alleging default September, 2006 till filing of ejectment application and bona fide personal need of the landlord. Learned Rent Controller vide order dated 18-9-2009 allowed ejectment application on ground of default. Ground of personal need was not accepted. Being aggrieved by order of the Rent Controller present petitioner filed appeal and learned Appellate Court passed order on 21-7-2009 and concurred with order of the learned Rent Controller.\n  2. Learned counsel for petitioner made the following submissions: ---\n  (i) That alleged default was for a period of six months i.e. September, 2006 to March, 2007 and therefore he should have been given benefit of provision of clause (ii) subsection (2) of section 15 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979, which provision was inserted by the amending Ordinance of 2001. He submitted rent for the period of March, 2007 was paid on 9-3-2007 through money order.\n  (ii) That rent application was filed through Abdul Qayoom Khan in whose favour a power of attorney has been stated to be executed on 15-1-2004. He submitted that although power of attorney is attested by Notary Public but signature of executant on power of attorney does not match with signatures of the executant on other documents available on record.\n  (iii) That before filing of rent application, landlord had moved application before Justice of Peace, in which ground of default was not stated. Learned counsel referred to cross-examination of the applicant and pointed out that the applicant in his cross-examination had stated as under:---\n  \"It is correct that I have not produced any documentary proof for the payment of monthly rent for the month of September, 2006 in February, 2007. It is' correct that Asghar Awan is not examined as witness in my favour however he left abroad.\"\n  (iv) That in affidavit-in-evidence, the appellant had produced money order receipt to establish that rent for March was paid through money order and no question in cross-examination was asked in respect of this document. Learned counsel relied upon Habib Ahmad v. Liaquat Hussain PLD 1985 Kar. 741, Abdul Samad Khan v. Asif Malik (Asif Zaman Khan) 1989 CLC 1994, Muhammad Akhtar v. Mst. Manna and 3 others 2001 SCMR 1700 and Imran Khan and others v. Aftab Khan 2008 CLC 1043.\n  3. Learned counsel for the respondent firstly submitted that this writ petition has been filed against concurrent findings of the fact and the proposition of law that High Court should be most reluctant to interfere with concurrent findings of fact needs no authority anymore. Secondly, benefit of provision of subsection (2) of section 15 cannot be availed by petitioner because petitioner did not fulfil conditions required by that provision.\n  4. I have considered submissions made by the learned counsel. I have also gone through the case-law- and the record of the petition.\n  5. Before proceeding further I may first refer proviso to clause (ii) subsection (2) of section 15 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979, which proviso was inserted by the amending Ordinance of 2001. The provision is in following words:---\n  \"(2) The Controller shall make an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the premises within such period as may be specified in the order if he is satisfied that:\n  (i) the tenancy has ceased to be valid under section 6.\n  (ii) the tenant has failed to pay rent in respect of the premises in his possession within fifteen days after the expiry of the period fixed by mutual agreement between the tenant and landlord for payment of the rent, or in the absence of which agreement, within sixty days after the rent has become due for payment:\n  [Provided that where the application made by the landlord is on the sole ground mentioned in this clause and the tenant on the first day of hearing admits his liability to pay the rent claimed from him, the Controller shall, if he is satisfied that the tenant has not made such default on any previous occasion and the default is not exceeding six months, direct the tenant to pay all the rent claimed from him on or before the date to be fixed for the purpose and upon such payment, he shall reject the application].\"\n  6. A bare perusal of the above provision would clearly indicate that it is applicable only when the following conditions are concurrently met:---\n  (i) Ejectment application is filed on sole ground of default.\n  (ii) Default does not exceed six months.\n  (iii) On the first date of hearing tenant admits his liability to pay rent claimed.\n  (iv) It is not a case of first default and Rent Controller directs tenant to pay rent claimed on or before the date to be fixed for this purpose.\n  7. It is only when all the four conditions are met that proviso to clause (ii) of subsection (2) of section 15 kicks in. If any or all of these conditions, even if a single of them are not these, proviso cannot be made application to the case.\n  8. In this case written statement is available at page 79 and default is specifically denied. In presence of such specific denial and particularly so in absence of clear statement of admission of liability be the tenant I do not think tenant can claim benefit of the said proviso.\n  9. As per questions relating to money order or power of attorney application to justice of peace are concerned, I do not think they need to be gone into when this Court is exercising jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan particularly in case where two Courts below have concurrently held that petitioner has committed wilful default. Both the Courts below have looked at in minute detail on the money order. It was for the month of March. It has been specially admitted by the petitioner in his cross-examination that he had not produced any documentary proof in respect of payment of monthly rent for the months of September, 2006 to February, 2007. There is no dispute between parties that rent for March, 2007 was paid but the question in this case was default from September, 2006 to February, 2007 and for that period tenant has not been able to convince the two Court bellows and also has not been able to point out infirmity or misreading of evidence. Case-law cited by learned counsel does not help his case.\n  10. In Imran Khan's case it was held that if assertion made in examination-in-chief was not controverted in cross-examination it will be deemed to have been admitted. But this case only be said in respect of rent paid for March, 2007. In cross-examination there was clear admission by the petitioner that he had no proof of payment from September, 2006 to February, 2007. In Liaquat Hussain's case it was held that it was compulsory for landlord to acknowledge receipt of rent in writing. In Abdul Samad Khan's case contention of landlord was that rent of premises had been subsequently enhanced and tenant had failed to 'deposit rent at the enhanced rate. It' was held that burden to prove enhancement of rent was on landlord. In Muhammad Akhtar's case there was question whether power of attorney is to be strictly construed. It is nobody case that power of attorney did not give authority in respect of a rent case. Therefore, references to the case-law by the learned counsel do not really help his case.\n  11. Be that as it may, in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction questions of fact cannot be gone normally into particularly when they have been decided, concurrently by the two Courts below. Constitutional Petition No.S-515 of 2009 is, therefore, dismissed in limine with listed application.\n  12.

      "case_proceddings": " Learned counsel for petitioner made the following submissions: ---\n  (i) That alleged default was for a period of six months i.e. September, 2006 to March, 2007 and therefore he should have been given benefit of provision of clause (ii) subsection (2) of section 15 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979, which provision was inserted by the amending Ordinance of 2001. He submitted rent for the period of March, 2007 was paid on 9-3-2007 through money order.\n  (ii) That rent application was filed through Abdul Qayoom Khan in whose favour a power of attorney has been stated to be executed on 15-1-2004. He submitted that although power of attorney is attested by Notary Public but signature of executant on power of attorney does not match with signatures of the executant on other documents available on record.\n  (iii) That before filing of rent application, landlord had moved application before Justice of Peace, in which ground of default was not stated. Learned counsel referred to cross-examination of the applicant and pointed out that the applicant in his cross-examination had stated as under:---\n  \"It is correct that I have not produced any documentary proof for the payment of monthly rent for the month of September, 2006 in February, 2007. It is' correct that Asghar Awan is not examined as witness in my favour however he left abroad.\"\n  (iv) That in affidavit-in-evidence, the appellant had produced money order receipt to establish that rent for March was paid through money order and no question in cross-examination was asked in respect of this document. Learned counsel relied upon Habib Ahmad v. Liaquat Hussain PLD 1985 Kar. 741, Abdul Samad Khan v. Asif Malik (Asif Zaman Khan) 1989 CLC 1994, Muhammad Akhtar v. Mst. Manna and 3 others 2001 SCMR 1700 and Imran Khan and others v. Aftab Khan 2008 CLC 1043.\n  3. Learned counsel for the respondent firstly submitted that this writ petition has been filed against concurrent findings of the fact and the proposition of law that High Court should be most reluctant to interfere with concurrent findings of fact needs no authority anymore. Secondly, benefit of provision of subsection (2) of section 15 cannot be availed by petitioner because petitioner did not fulfil conditions required by that provision.\n  4.

The petitioner is the widow of said Mubashar Ali who did not have any issue while Mst. Ghulam Sakina is his mother. The learned trial Court passed an order on 20-2-2009 stating that the succession certificate be issued in favour of the legal heirs of the deceased in the sum of Rs.5,50,000 but this amount be disbursed in accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Police Department. The respondent filed a first appeal which has been decided by a learned Additional District Judge, Jhelum, on 9-6-2009 who has directed that the amount be disbursed amongst the said parents and widow of the deceased in accordance with their Muslim Law shares.\n  2. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the amount of Group Insurance did not form part of the estate of the deceased and as such was to be collected by the petitioner in accordance with the rules being the widow. The other amounts being payable to the family of the deceased are to be distributed amongst the parents and widow of the deceased. He relies on the case of Wafaqi Hakoomat-e-Pakistan v. Awamunnas PLD 1991 SC 731. Learned counsel for the respondent supports the impugned order of the learned Additional District Judge.\n  3. I have gone through the copies of the records with the assistance of the learned counsel for the parties. Out of the said total amount, a sum of Rs.1,40,000 is payable as Group Insurance. This amount has been held by Shariat Appellate Bench of the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the said case of Federal Government of Pakistan v. Public at Large not to be part of the estate of the deceased (page 749 of the judgment refers). I, therefore, do find that this amount of Rs. 1,40,000 is exclusively payable to the petitioner/widow if duly nominated by the deceased. The remaining amount is payable to the family of the deceased. This will be distributed accordingly amongst the parents and the widow. The civil revision is accordingly partly allowed and is disposed of.

The brief facts of the case are that the land measuring 122 Kanals, 18 Marlas situated in village Ghannian Tehsil Kamoki District Gujranwala had been purchased by the petitioner for a consideration of Rs.70,00,000 through an agreement to sell dated 13-11-1990 from Muhammad Yousaf etc. and Rs.40,00,000 were paid in advance by the petitioner to the vendors mentioned in the agreement to sell while Rs.30,00,000 were to be paid by the petitioner to the vendors at the time of execution of registered sale-deed. It is submitted that the last date for execution of registered sale-deed was fixed as 13-3-1991 and a condition was also imposed in the said agreement that possession of the same was being handed over to the petitioner, who could get the sale-deed executed in his own name or in the name of any other person to whom he liked. The petitioner had been operating his Account No.1805 got opened with respondent No.3 i.e. N.I.C.F.C. and the petitioner was in the need of financial facility for which he was short of Rs.15,00,000. So he entered into a contract with the Corporation in order to get the financial facility of Rs.15,00,000. Consequently an agreement dated 7-3-1991 was executed between the petitioner and the Corporation for specific performance regarding the land in dispute which the petitioner had purchased for Rs.70,00,000. The petitioner got executed registered sale-deed in the name of Corporation vide Document No.514 dated 10-3-1991 and Bahi No.1 with the Sub-Registrar Kamoki. The petitioner moved an application before the Chairman, P.C.B.L., Lahore that the above-said land was owned and possessed by him as he had purchased the same through an agreement dated 13-11-1990 executed in favour of the petitioner and the total consideration amount was settled Rs.70,00,000 out of which Rs.40,00,000 had already been paid by the petitioner to the original owners and the last date for completion of the transaction was 13-3-1991, but he could not arrange for the payment of the remaining amount of Rs.30,00,000. As he was an account-holder of N.I.C.F.C. and short amount of Rs.15,00,000 out of Rs.30,00,000, the petitioner got the sale-deed executed in favour of N.I.C.F.C. as Benami transaction, but actually the land belonged to him. The petitioner requested for issuance of NOC and execution of sale-deed in his favour. The P.C.B.L. through the impugned order has rejected the claim of the petitioner.\n  3. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the petitioner is continuously in possession of the disputed land without any interruption and the Revenue Record supports the claim of the petitioner, hence the finding arrived at by the P.C.B.L. is liable to be set aside and the case may be remanded to P.C.B.L. as the decision has been made without affording an opportunity of producing the evidence in support of his claim by the petitioner. Relies upon Iqbal Haider and 3 others v. P.C.B.L. through Chairman and 14 others 2006 YLR 910 and Kh. Zia Ullah and 5 others v. P.C.B.L. through Chairman and 3 others 2006 YLR 924 in support of his contentions and contends that the evidence was necessary to be recorded after framing of the issues. It is further contended that the Manager of the defunct Corporation, namely, Rana Muhammad Sarwar has reported to the P.C.B.L. that the petitioner was the actual owner of the disputed land and it was a Benami transaction, who also recommended the case of the petitioner, but in spite of that the respondent has rejected his claim on surmises and conjectures.\n  4. Learned counsel for the P.C.B.L. Mr. Muhammad Ilyas Khan has opposed this petition on the ground that sale-deed had been executed in favour of the N.I.C.F.C. and the record of the said defunct Corporation does not support the petitioner's claim for the payment of Rs.1.5 million by the N.I.C.F.C.. It is also contended that there is no evidence on the record to show that the sale-deed was actually a Benami transaction and payment was not made by the N.I.C.F.C., but the petitioner made it. It is also contended that presumption of truth is attached to the registered sale-deed and oral statement of the petitioner is not sufficient to believe that the petitioner had made the payment and he was the actual buyer. Also contended that it is quite easy to prepare an unregistered agreement to sell and the said agreement to sell also shows that without taking the possession the petitioner had paid more than half amount i.e. Rs.40,00,000 out of Rs.70 lacs without any receipt from the original owner and the petition may be dismissed.\n  5. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also perused the impugned order as also the documents attached with this petition. The petitioner has raised the claim only on the basis of agreement to sell. It is well-settled principle of law that the agreement to sell does not confer any title. Even otherwise after the perusal of the agreement it is found doubtful that the petitioner had purchased the land for a total consideration of Rs.70 lac and he made payment of Rs.40 lac to the original owners without taking the possession thereof as per agreement to sell and if the petitioner was already in possession of the property, this fact was not got mentioned in the agreement to sell. It is strange that the possession was not delivered to the petitioner in spite of the fact that Rs.40 lac had allegedly been paid by the petitioner. Learned counsel for the petitioner during arguments has claimed that the petitioner had been inducted in possession of land since from Kharif 1990 and is in. continuous possession of the land. The possibility cannot be ruled out for claiming ownership of the said property an ante-dated agreement to sell has been forged to grab the said property which had been transferred in the name of N.I.C.F.C. through registered sale-deed.\n  6. So far as the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the Manager of the defunct Corporation is supporting the claim of the petitioner is concerned, it has been denied by the learned counsel for the respondent and after perusal of the record it is informed that only a resolution had been passed that it was a Benami transaction and the manager was authorized for entering into any Benami transaction whereas the sale-deed discloses that the said property had been purchased in the name of N.I.C.F.C., but the record and ledger do not support the contention of the petitioner. The claim of the petitioner that the sale-deed had been executed in favour of N.I.C.F.C. as Benami transaction and the said Corporation only paid an amount of Rs.15,00,000 is nowhere mentioned in the record of N.I.C.F.C. The oral assertion of the petitioner merely supported by the ex-manager without any documentary evidence, who had subsequently joined hands in numerous cases with the fraudulent persons to grab the property of the Undesirable Cooperative Societies cannot be given any importance over the registered document. As regards contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the evidence was not recorded and issues were not framed, suffice it to say that the order passed by the learned P.C.B.L. is well-reasoned whereby each and every aspect of the case has been discussed. The inherent defects in the claim of the petitioner were sufficient to reject the claim of the petitioner and there was no necessity to frame the issues when the petitioner had failed to make out a prima facie case for the issuance of NOC in his favour.\n  7. No ground for interference is made out and there is no reason for remanding the case back to P.C.B.L. for lingering on the matter in order to provide another opportunity to the petitioner to retain the possession for further period. The case-law cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case.

      "case_facts": "The brief facts of the case are that the land measuring 122 Kanals, 18 Marlas situated in village Ghannian Tehsil Kamoki District Gujranwala had been purchased by the petitioner for a consideration of Rs.70,00,000 through an agreement to sell dated 13-11-1990 from Muhammad Yousaf etc. and Rs.40,00,000 were paid in advance by the petitioner to the vendors mentioned in the agreement to sell while Rs.30,00,000 were to be paid by the petitioner to the vendors at the time of execution of registered sale-deed. It is submitted that the last date for execution of registered sale-deed was fixed as 13-3-1991 and a condition was also imposed in the said agreement that possession of the same was being handed over to the petitioner, who could get the sale-deed executed in his own name or in the name of any other person to whom he liked. The petitioner had been operating his Account No.1805 got opened with respondent No.3 i.e. N.I.C.F.C. and the petitioner was in the need of financial facility for which he was short of Rs.15,00,000. So he entered into a contract with the Corporation in order to get the financial facility of Rs.15,00,000. Consequently an agreement dated 7-3-1991 was executed between the petitioner and the Corporation for specific performance regarding the land in dispute which the petitioner had purchased for Rs.70,00,000. The petitioner got executed registered sale-deed in the name of Corporation vide Document No.514 dated 10-3-1991 and Bahi No.1 with the Sub-Registrar Kamoki. The petitioner moved an application before the Chairman, P.C.B.L., Lahore that the above-said land was owned and possessed by him as he had purchased the same through an agreement dated 13-11-1990 executed in favour of the petitioner and the total consideration amount was settled Rs.70,00,000 out of which Rs.40,00,000 had already been paid by the petitioner to the original owners and the last date for completion of the transaction was 13-3-1991, but he could not arrange for the payment of the remaining amount of Rs.30,00,000. As he was an account-holder of N.I.C.F.C. and short amount of Rs.15,00,000 out of Rs.30,00,000, the petitioner got the sale-deed executed in favour of N.I.C.F.C. as Benami transaction, but actually the land belonged to him. The petitioner requested for issuance of NOC and execution of sale-deed in his favour. The P.C.B.L. through the impugned order has rejected the claim of the petitioner.",
      "case_judgement": "No ground for interference is made out and there is no reason for remanding the case back to P.C.B.L. for lingering on the matter in order to provide another opportunity to the petitioner to retain the possession for further period. The case-law cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case. This petition having no merit is dismissed.\n  S.A.K./G-71/L Petition dismissed.",
      "case_proceddings": "Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the petitioner is continuously in possession of the disputed land without any interruption and the Revenue Record supports the claim of the petitioner, hence the finding arrived at by the P.C.B.L. is liable to be set aside and the case may be remanded to P.C.B.L. as the decision has been made without affording an opportunity of producing the evidence in support of his claim by the petitioner. Relies upon Iqbal Haider and 3 others v. P.C.B.L. through Chairman and 14 others 2006 YLR 910 and Kh. Zia Ullah and 5 others v. P.C.B.L. through Chairman and 3 others 2006 YLR 924 in support of his contentions and contends that the evidence was necessary to be recorded after framing of the issues. It is further contended that the Manager of the defunct Corporation, namely, Rana Muhammad Sarwar has reported to the P.C.B.L. that the petitioner was the actual owner of the disputed land and it was a Benami transaction, who also recommended the case of the petitioner, but in spite of that the respondent has rejected his claim on surmises and conjectures.\n  4. Learned counsel for the P.C.B.L. Mr. Muhammad Ilyas Khan has opposed this petition on the ground that sale-deed had been executed in favour of the N.I.C.F.C. and the record of the said defunct Corporation does not support the petitioner's claim for the payment of Rs.1.5 million by the N.I.C.F.C.. It is also contended that there is no evidence on the record to show that the sale-deed was actually a Benami transaction and payment was not made by the N.I.C.F.C., but the petitioner made it. It is also contended that presumption of truth is attached to the registered sale-deed and oral statement of the petitioner is not sufficient to believe that the petitioner had made the payment and he was the actual buyer. Also contended that it is quite easy to prepare an unregistered agreement to sell and the said agreement to sell also shows that without taking the possession the petitioner had paid more than half amount i.e. Rs.40,00,000 out of Rs.70 lacs without any receipt from the original owner and the petition may be dismissed.\n  5. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also perused the impugned order as also the documents attached with this petition. The petitioner has raised the claim only on the basis of agreement to sell. It is well-settled principle of law that the agreement to sell does not confer any title. Even otherwise after the perusal of the agreement it is found doubtful that the petitioner had purchased the land for a total consideration of Rs.70 lac and he made payment of Rs.40 lac to the original owners without taking the possession thereof as per agreement to sell and if the petitioner was already in possession of the property, this fact was not got mentioned in the agreement to sell. It is strange that the possession was not delivered to the petitioner in spite of the fact that Rs.40 lac had allegedly been paid by the petitioner. Learned counsel for the petitioner during arguments has claimed that the petitioner had been inducted in possession of land since from Kharif 1990 and is in. continuous possession of the land. The possibility cannot be ruled out for claiming ownership of the said property an ante-dated agreement to sell has been forged to grab the said property which had been transferred in the name of N.I.C.F.C. through registered sale-deed.\n  6. So far as the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the Manager of the defunct Corporation is supporting the claim of the petitioner is concerned, it has been denied by the learned counsel for the respondent and after perusal of the record it is informed that only a resolution had been passed that it was a Benami transaction and the manager was authorized for entering into any Benami transaction whereas the sale-deed discloses that the said property had been purchased in the name of N.I.C.F.C., but the record and ledger do not support the contention of the petitioner. The claim of the petitioner that the sale-deed had been executed in favour of N.I.C.F.C. as Benami transaction and the said Corporation only paid an amount of Rs.15,00,000 is nowhere mentioned in the record of N.I.C.F.C.

The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner contested the elections for the above year as President. During the course of elections, as per her version, certain illegalities and irregularities were noticed, on which, the election was stopped but, however, later, the same was conducted again against the wishes and the consent of the present petitioner.\n  3. Since the irregularities and illegalities were noticed and found to be as correct, the subsequent conduct and election is challenged to be as illegal exercise of jurisdiction. Consequently, through this writ petition, the direction is sought for declaring the election result to be as illegal, ineffective. Further directions are sought to hold the same again after mutual agreement harmoniously acceptable to all concerned.\n  4. The petitioner was asked to explain as to how a writ petition in the circumstances of this case was maintainable. Her answer was that there is no other remedy. She, however, did not, reply as to how the respondents in this case became a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a Local Authority.\n  5. In fact, writ petition in this case cannot be entertained as the same is not against a person defined under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Under Article 199, an aggrieved person can undoubtedly challenge the order of any functionary working in or under the Federal Government, a Provincial Government or local authorities of this country. The High Court Bar Association, Bahawalpur, is obviously neither performing the functions of the Federal Government or a Provincial Government or a local authority. The High Court Bar Association Bahawalpur is basically an \"Association\". Its by-laws and rules have been prepared for its members to manage its own affairs. It is an association within its own framework for which its members and election rules, if any, are prepared to conducts it affairs within themselves. The Election Commission having been nominated under the said rules of the Association also does not have any status of a functionary dealing, with the matters of State. The provision of Article 199 of the Constitution, therefore, would not apply in any form thereon the facts mentioned in the petition are not being discussed obviously for the reason of the maintainability of a writ petition under the circumstances. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of Ardeshir Cowasjee and 7 others v. K.B.C.A. and others 2002 CLC 673 wherein while dealing, Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, it has been stated that:---\n  \"Persons expressly mentioned in Article 199 of the Constitution include persons performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority. Builder in a private business is not a \"person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority\". No direction to, or order against a private person can be made in a constitutional petition.\"\n  Further reliance can be placed on Maqsood Ahmed Toor and 4 others v. Federation of Pakistan through the Secretary to the Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Housing and Works, Islamabad and others 2000 SCMR 928 wherein it has been held that:---\n  \"Person performing function in connection with affairs of Federation/Province\". Primary test must always be as to whether the functions entrusted to the organization or person or indeed function of the State involving some exercise of sovereign or public powers; whether the control of organization in substantial manner is in the hands of Government and whether the bulk of the funds is provided by the State.

Junaid Cheema, Flying Officer, AHQ, Peshawar.\n  Date of hearing: 16th July, 2009.\n    JUDGMENT\n  MAULVI ANWARUL HAQ, J.--- The petitioner while performing his duties as a Wing Commander in the Medical Administrative Wing of PAF Base, Lahore, was charged with several offences mentioned in charge sheet dated 30-1-2002. The charges were formally read over to the petitioner on 6-2-2002 by a Field General Court Martial convened\" to try the petitioner. The trial accordingly commenced and ultimately the petitioner was found guilty of the second and third charges and was sentenced to simple imprisonment for two months as also dismissal from service. An appeal filed against the said conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Court of Appeals.\n  2. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the offences are stated to have been committed during the period January to June, 2000 while he was on secondment to PAF. He was, however, reverted to Pakistan Army w.e.f. 18-9-2000 vide Annexure \"B\" whereas the trial commenced against him on 6-2-2002. The precise contention is that he could not have been tried by the FGCM in view of the bar contained in section 121(2) of the Pakistan Air Force Act, 1953, after six months of his reversion to the Army. Also refers to section 2(e) read with section 3 of the said Act of 1953. Learned Standing Counsel for Pakistan, on the other hand, draws my attention to Annex-C to the writ petition by which order the petitioner who by then had been promoted as a Lt. Colonel in the Pakistan Army was again posted to the PAF Base, Lahore, w.e.f. 9-11-2001. His contention is that when the trial commenced the petitioner was subject to the provisions of PAF Act, 1953 and the trial, the conviction and the sentence recorded are with jurisdiction.\n  3. I have given some .thought to the respective contentions of the learned counsel and the learned Law Officer and have examined the file in the light of the said provisions of law being relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner. The petitioner while serving as a Major in the Pakistan Army was seconded to PAF in the corresponding rank of Squadron Leader vide Annexure \"B\". He was reverted back to Pakistan Arm w.e.f. 25-9-2000. Vide Annexure \"A\" he was promoted as a Lt. Col. w.e.f. 6-10-2000. Vide Annexure \"C\" he was again seconded PAF at PAF Base, Lahore w.e.f. 12-11-2001. The trial, as noted above, commenced before the FGCM on 6-2-2002.\n  4. The precise contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that under section 2(e) of the PAF Act, 1953, the petitioner upon secondment was a person subject to PAF Act, 1953. However, the application of the said Act of 1953, terminated on 25-9-2000 when he was sent back to the Pakistan Army and according to the learned counsel in terms of section 121(2) of the said Act, the petitioner could not have been tried for an offence after six months of the said date.\n  5. The learned Standing Counsel, on the other hand, is of the opinion that since the petitioner was, in fact, subject to PAF Act, 1953, on the date when the trial commenced, the bar contained in section 121(2) of PAF Act, 1953, would not be applicable.\n  6. I deem it appropriate to reproduce hereunder the relevant subsections (1) and (2) of the said section 121:--\n  \"121. Liability of offender who ceases to be subject to Act.--- (1) Where an offence under this Act had been committed by any person while subject to this Act, and he has ceased to be so subject, he may be taken into and kept in Air Force custody, and tried and punished for such offence as if he had continued to be so subject.\n  (2) Except as provided by subsections (3) and (4) any such person shall not be tried for an offence, unless his trial commences within six months after he has ceased to be subject to this Act.\"\n  It will be seen that subsection (1) is an enabling provision inasmuch as it enables the respondent to take into custody and try and punish a person for an offence committed by him under the said Act while he was subject to the Act at a point of time he ceases to be so subject. Subsection (2) lays down the limitation i.e. that such a person shall not be tried for such an offence unless his trial commences within six months of the date he ceases to be subject to the said Act. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, after the expiry of six months from the first reversion of his client from PAF to Pakistan Army, the bar contained in section 121(2) shall become operative and notwithstanding the fact that he was subject to the PAF Act, 1953, when the trial commenced the bar would remain effective.\n  7. I am unable to agree with the learned counsel. On a proper interpretation what is required is that a person should either be subject to the PAF Act, 1953, when he is tried for an offence committed under the Act or six months had not elapsed Since his ceasing to be so subject to the said Act.\n  8. This is the natural consequence flowing from the fact that it is necessary that the offence must have been committed by the person committing the same while he was subject to the Act. Consequently according to the facts of the present case, there is no denial that the petitioner was subject to PAF Act, 1953 when the offences he was charged with were alleged to be committed and the same was the position when the trial commenced. The writ petition accordingly is dismissed but without any orders as to costs.\n  S.A.K./M-589/L Petition dismissed.",

His contention is that when the trial commenced the petitioner was subject to the provisions of PAF Act, 1953 and the trial, the conviction and the sentence recorded are with jurisdiction.\n  3. I have given some .thought to the respective contentions of the learned counsel and the learned Law Officer and have examined the file in the light of the said provisions of law being relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner. The petitioner while serving as a Major in the Pakistan Army was seconded to PAF in the corresponding rank of Squadron Leader vide Annexure \"B\". He was reverted back to Pakistan Arm w.e.f. 25-9-2000. Vide Annexure \"A\" he was promoted as a Lt. Col. w.e.f. 6-10-2000. Vide Annexure \"C\" he was again seconded PAF at PAF Base, Lahore w.e.f. 12-11-2001. The trial, as noted above, commenced before the FGCM on 6-2-2002.\n  4. The precise contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that under section 2(e) of the PAF Act, 1953, the petitioner upon secondment was a person subject to PAF Act, 1953. However, the application of the said Act of 1953, terminated on 25-9-2000 when he was sent back to the Pakistan Army and according to the learned counsel in terms of section 121(2) of the said Act, the petitioner could not have been tried for an offence after six months of the said date.\n  5. The learned Standing Counsel, on the other hand, is of the opinion that since the petitioner was, in fact, subject to PAF Act, 1953, on the date when the trial commenced, the bar contained in section 121(2) of PAF Act, 1953, would not be applicable.\n  6. I deem it appropriate to reproduce hereunder the relevant subsections (1) and (2) of the said section 121:--\n  \"121. Liability of offender who ceases to be subject to Act.--- (1) Where an offence under this Act had been committed by any person while subject to this Act, and he has ceased to be so subject, he may be taken into and kept in Air Force custody, and tried and punished for such offence as if he had continued to be so subject.\n  (2) Except as provided by subsections (3) and (4) any such person shall not be tried for an offence, unless his trial commences within six months after he has ceased to be subject to this Act.\"\n  It will be seen that subsection (1) is an enabling provision inasmuch as it enables the respondent to take into custody and try and punish a person for an offence committed by him under the said Act while he was subject to the Act at a point of time he ceases to be so subject.

Muhammad Jehangir Wahlah for Respondents.\n  Date of hearing: 9th July, 2009.\n    JUDGMENT\n  MAULVI ANWARUL HAQ, J.--- On 19-2-1991 respondents Nos.1 to 13 filed a suit against Inayat Ali predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners as well as the remaining respondents. In the plaint it was stated that the last male owner of the suit-land mentioned in plaint was Moula Bukhsh, who died on 29-7-1953. The father of the said plaintiffs died on 6-10-1956 while Ali Muhammad father of the said Inayat Ali died on 19-3-1963 while Ilam Din predecessor-in-interest of the remaining respondents died on 16-12-1952 and Fazal Din and Nawab Din died before independence of the country while Karam Din died in the year, 1951. Latter three persons died issueless and unmarried and as such on the death of Moula Bukhsh only Wali Muhammad and Ilam Din were surviving heirs. However, in Mutation of Inheritance No.163 attested on 13-10-1960 all the said dead persons were shown as alive and mutation was attested accordingly, whereas the plaintiffs on the one hand and Inayat Ali on the other were only legal heirs entitled to share each. The plaintiffs and Inayat Ali filed a suit against the remaining respondents on 25-5-1978 seeking a declaration that Ilam Din having died before Moula Bukhsh was not entitled to inherit a share in the estate of Moula Bukhsh. This suit was decreed on 29-9-1979 but Inayat Ali got Mutation No.1387 attested whereby, 5/6 share was mutated in his favour and 1/6 in favour of the plaintiffs. Then there is reference to another suit, which was earlier filed and withdrawn with permission to file afresh. A declaration was sought accordingly and setting aside of Mutation No.1387 attested on 31-12-1987 was prayed for. The suit was contested only by Inayat Ali. His plea was that all the said four brothers, namely, Ilam Din, Fazal Din, Nawab Din and Karam Din died somewhere between 13-10-1960 and 19-3-1963. It was asserted that mutation 163 was got entered by Abdul Hameed, plaintiff himself. The filing of the suit by both the parties and fact that it was decreed was not denied. However, it was stated that Mutation No.1387 is lawful. Issues were framed. Evidence of the parties was recorded. The learned trial Court dismissed the suit vide judgment and decree- dated 31-3-1997. A first appeal filed by the plaintiff was allowed by a learned Additional District Judge, Faisalabad, on 27-6-2001, who partly decreed the suit. I may note here that after examining the evidence the learned Additional District Judge held that Ilam Din was not alive when Moula Bukhsh died and further that parties i.e. plaintiff and Inayat Ali will inherit the estate of Fazal Din and Nawab Din equally, while estate of Karam Din will go to Inayat Ali exclusively.\n  2. Learned counsel for the petitioners have argued that the suit was barred by time and they rely on the case of Muhammad Hussain and others v. Muhammad Shafi and others 2008 SCMR 230. Further contention is that admission made by Inayat Ali would be relevant only for the purpose of suit filed by the parties jointly and not for this suit which had to be decided on the basis of evidence recorded therein. Reliance is placed on the case of Muqarrab Hussain through LRs and another v. Pirzada Muhammad Rafiq 2001 YLR 1103. Learned counsel for the plaintiffs supports the impugned judgment and decree of the learned Additional District Judge, Faisalabad, with reference to evidence on record.\n  3. I have gone through the copies of the records. The learned Additional District Judge has primarily relied upon Exh.P.5, which is plaint in the suit admittedly filed jointly by Inayat Ali and the plaintiffs. He was duly confronted with said plaint and he admitted that he was plaintiff in the case but proceeded to state that his signatures were obtained through some manoeuvring. It is stated in para.11 of the said plaint that share of brothers of Ilam Din who are dead has already devolved upon the plaintiffs in the said suit, Exh.P.5. The bald allegation of Inayat Ali D.W.2 would be of no avail as he is defending the mutation that was attested with reference to the decree passed in the said suit filed by him along with plaintiffs. Apart from this he was confronted and he stated that he has no personal knowledge of date of death of Fazal Din, I1am Din, Karam Din and Nawab Din but these were told to him by his father that he has not produced their death certificates. In response to further cross-examination he stated that he does not remember the dates of death of the said persons.\n  4. Coming to the said judgment in the case of \"Muqarrab Hussain through L. Rs. the admission in the said case was made in the ground of appeal and ground of revision which documents are not required to be verified on oath unlike a plaint, or a written statement, besides the said admission was found to be factually incorrect with reference to the evidence recorded in the said case. In the present case the admission has been made in a plaint admittedly filed by Inayat Ali along with plaintiffs. Needless to state that a plaint is part of pleadings and admissions made in the pleadings are species which are binding and can be used against the maker of the same and as held in the case of Ahmad Khan v. Rasul Shah and other PLD 1975 SC 311 besides, he was given a chance by the cross-examiner to show that admission was wrong but he failed to do so as he was unable to state the dates of death of said person and further relied upon hearsay attributed by him to his father.\n  5. So far as the question of limitation is concerned, the suit filed by both the contesting parties had been decreed. The grievance arose because of the mutation attested on 31-12-1987. The suit filed on 19-2-1991 was, therefore, well within time prescribed by Article 120 of the limitation Act, 1908. Civil revision is accordingly dismissed but without any order as to costs.\n  S.A.K./M-588/L Revision dismissed.",

In the application she stated that she contracted to purchase open Plot No.C-167, Block-I, North Nazimabad, Karachi, with the exception of only one shop in occupation of present respondent No.1 as tenant thereof. After entering into an agreement she published a notice in newspaper and then applied for transfer and mutation, which was accordingly issued on 21-8-2007 in her name by Deputy District Officer North Nazimabad of City District Government Karachi. It was further pleaded that opponent was old tenant of one Khawaja Muhammad Saleem in respect of shop in question. The opponent paid rent for the months of October and November, 2006 to the petitioner and thereafter stopped payment of rent. Default of rent was from November, 2006 till filing of ejectment application, which was filed in February, 2008.\n  In written statement it was contended by the present respondent No.1 that he acquired a piece of land 27 years ago and himself constructed a shop there. However after completion of shop said Mr. Khawaja Muhammad Saleem came and demanded rent while showing himself to be owner of plot in question. It was further pleaded in written statement that opponent being illiterate person believed claim of Khawaja Saleem and started paying monthly rent which he continued to pay for two months even after the present petitioner had purchased that property. It was further contended in written statement that when he became aware regarding factual position in respect of the shop, he stopped payment of rent.\n  Ejectment application was allowed by the Rent Controller by holding that present respondent No.1 was tenant of previous owner namely Khawaja Muhammad Saleem to whom he was paying rent regularly and thereafter he also paid rent to the present applicant.\n  An application under section 16(1) of Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 was filed. Counter affidavit was filed to that application. Thereafter statement was filed by landlord stating that she is prepared to drop her claim in respect of arrears of rent due against opponent if eviction of opponent is ordered without recording evidence, because of admission by the petitioner about non-payment of rent. This statement was duly taken on record and the Rent Controller on the basis of admission made by opponent in the rent case holding that it is well settled principle of law that opponent cannot be permitted to take different stand during evidence than he had taken in his written statement as well as in objection to application under section 16(1) Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979.\n  Being aggrieved by the order of the Rent Controller, present respondent No.1 filed First Rent Appeal, F.R.A. was allowed and it was observed that since there is dispute about relationship of landlord and tenant, the case was remanded to the Rent Controller for recording evidence on the point of existence of relationship of landlord and tenant. Being aggrieved by the order passed in First Rent Appeal, this Constitutional Petition has been filed.\n  On 27-8-2009 learned counsel for respondent was put on notice that if on next date tic did not appear no further adjournment will be granted and matter would be heard and decided. Today no one is present for the respondent, I, therefore heard learned counsel for the petitioner.\n  In the written statement in para. No.1, it was stated as follows:--\n  \"(1) That the contents of paras. No.1 of the application under reply are admitted upto the extent of Plot No.C-167, Block-I, North Nazimabad, Karachi, but as far as the opponent as a tenant is concerned, in this regard it is submitted that the opponent had acquired the piece of land 27 years ago and after that the opponent himself got the shop in question constructed but just after completion of the shop Khawaja Saleem owner of the Plot No.C-167, came and demanded the rent while showing himself to be owner of the plot in question.

No.3, it was stated as follows:---\n  That the contents of paras. Nos.3 and 4, of the application under reply is admitted upto the extent of monthly rent Rs.750 subject to unawareness regarding the facts of the plot, as far as being a tenant opponent is liable to pay the monthly rent is concerned, in this pretext it is pertinent to bring on record that the opponent stopped to deposit the monthly rent in MRC, after refusing the money order as per mentioned in this para., when the real fact of the piece of land on which opponent's shop is standing came into knowledge of opponent. On the contrary opponent just after knowing that the piece of land on which the shop is standing is the property of City District Government of Karachi, moved application for obtaining the same being an old occupant, as such the applicant is not legally entitled to claim the monthly rent on the plot in question which is not the property of applicant. As such the rent case is liable to be dismissed.\"\n  When application under section 16(1) Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 was filed, in counter affidavit, respondent No.1 stated as under:---\n  \"(1) That I say that the applicant is not entitled to get the monthly rent from me, as the applicant neither claim to be owner of plot measuring 760 Sq. yds, adjacent to the Plot No.0 167, measuring 600 Sq. yds, as per record for which I have already produced the documentary evidence along with the written statement as Annexures \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\", nor the said plot cannot be transferred without due course of law, as laid down in the SLGO 2001.\n  (5) That I say that the documents produced by the applicant related to the mutation made by the CDGX is required to be examined according to the law, as to how the CDGK can mutate the plot measuring 760 sq. yds, adjacent to the Plot No.C-167, without due course of law, if the document provide false, so the applicant is liable to be prosecuted under section 195, Cr.P.C. by this Honourable Court in the light of under sections 468, 471, P.P.C.\"\n  There is thus clear admission by the respondent No.1 that firstly he paid rent for more than 20 years to Khawaja Muhammad Saleem and secondly he even paid rent to the petitioner for a period of two months. Secondly the respondent No.1 in his written statement stated that he acquired a piece of land 27 years ago. Under what authority did he acquire that land? Did he purchase it? Was it gifted to him or is he a mere trespasser? He has all along with chosen to stay mum.\n  It is settled law that landlord may not be the owner. Once a tenant, always a tenant is also settled law.

It is settled law that when tenant denies relationship of landlord and tenant and such relationship stood proved, then there is no other way left to the Court but to order ejectment of the tenant. In this case respondent No.1 firstly accepted that he was a tenant then accepted that he stopped paying rent.

In the application she stated that she contracted to purchase open Plot No.C-167, Block-I, North Nazimabad, Karachi, with the exception of only one shop in occupation of present respondent No.1 as tenant thereof. After entering into an agreement she published a notice in newspaper and then applied for transfer and mutation, which was accordingly issued on 21-8-2007 in her name by Deputy District Officer North Nazimabad of City District Government Karachi. It was further pleaded that opponent was old tenant of one Khawaja Muhammad Saleem in respect of shop in question. The opponent paid rent for the months of October and November, 2006 to the petitioner and thereafter stopped payment of rent. Default of rent was from November, 2006 till filing of ejectment application, which was filed in February, 2008.\n  In written statement it was contended by the present respondent No.1 that he acquired a piece of land 27 years ago and himself constructed a shop there. However after completion of shop said Mr. Khawaja Muhammad Saleem came and demanded rent while showing himself to be owner of plot in question. It was further pleaded in written statement that opponent being illiterate person believed claim of Khawaja Saleem and started paying monthly rent which he continued to pay for two months even after the present petitioner had purchased that property.

      "case_proceddings": "Ejectment application was allowed by the Rent Controller by holding that present respondent No.1 was tenant of previous owner namely Khawaja Muhammad Saleem to whom he was paying rent regularly and thereafter he also paid rent to the present applicant.\n  An application under section 16(1) of Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 was filed. Counter affidavit was filed to that application. Thereafter statement was filed by landlord stating that she is prepared to drop her claim in respect of arrears of rent due against opponent if eviction of opponent is ordered without recording evidence, because of admission by the petitioner about non-payment of rent. This statement was duly taken on record and the Rent Controller on the basis of admission made by opponent in the rent case holding that it is well settled principle of law that opponent cannot be permitted to take different stand during evidence than he had taken in his written statement as well as in objection to application under section 16(1) Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979.\n  Being aggrieved by the order of the Rent Controller, present respondent No.1 filed First Rent Appeal, F.R.A. was allowed and it was observed that since there is dispute about relationship of landlord and tenant, the case was remanded to the Rent Controller for recording evidence on the point of existence of relationship of landlord and tenant. Being aggrieved by the order passed in First Rent Appeal, this Constitutional Petition has been filed.\n  On 27-8-2009 learned counsel for respondent was put on notice that if on next date tic did not appear no further adjournment will be granted and matter would be heard and decided. Today no one is present for the respondent, I, therefore heard learned counsel for the petitioner.\n  In the written statement in para.

A.-G. for Respondents.\n  Date of hearing: 30th September, 2009.\n    JUDGMENT\n  HAFIZ ABDUR REHMAN ANSARI, J.--- Through this Civil Revision petition under section 115, C.P.C., petitioners Shaukat Hayat etc., have assailed the judgments and decrees dated 7-5-2003 and 17-3-2004. Through the former judgment and decree dated 7-5-2003 the suit of the petitioners for declaration to the effect that the plaintiffs-petitioners are owners in possession of the suit property measuring 10 Kanals and gift Mutation No.312 dated 23-8-1980, allegedly gift made by the plaintiffs in favour of defendant No.2, is against law and facts, was dismissed by the learned Civil Judge, Multan. Through the latter judgment and decree dated 17-3-2004 the appeal filed by the petitioners-plaintiffs against the judgment and decree of the trial Court was also dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge, Multan.\n  2. Brief facts of the instant revision petition are that present petitioners filed a suit for declaration and permanent injunction that they are owners-in-possession of the suit property and the gift Mutation No.312 dated 23-8-1980 allegedly made by the plaintiffs-petitioners in favour of respondent-defendant No.2/Health Department, Government of the Punjab, is against the law and result of fraud and liable to be declared void and cancelled. It is further alleged in the plaint that the plaintiffs are owners in possession of the land measuring 10 Kanals situated in Khewat No.165 of the Revenue estate of Mouza Soman, Tehsil Shujabad, District Multan. It is further alleged that the defendants-respondents being collusive with the Revenue officials have fraudulently got attested the impugned mutation for the purpose of establishment of a dispensary but the dispensary has not been established by the defendant No.2/respondent therefore the impugned mutation is illegal, against the law and facts. It is further alleged that the plaintiffs-petitioners did not appear before the Revenue Officer for attestation of the impugned mutation.\n  3. Defendants-respondents did not file their written statements so their defence was struck off on 11-12-2002. Evidence of the plaintiffs-petitioners was recorded wherein they produced Muhammad Hayat as P. W .1, Muhammad Ramzan as P. W . 2 and Karim Bakhsh as P. W. 3. Power of attorney was filed as Exh. P.1 The impugned mutation had been filed as Exh.P.2, copy of record of rights as Exh.P.3, copy of Rapt Roznamcha as Exh.P.4, copy of Khasra Girdawari Exh.P.5 to Exh.P.9 and copy of record of rights as Each. P.10. As no written statement was filed, defence of the defendants-respondents was struck off, so no evidence was produced on behalf of the defendants-respondents in rebuttal of the evidence of the plaintiffs-petitioners. Anyhow, the learned trial Court vide judgment and decree dated 7-5-2003 dismissed the suit of the plaintiffs. The present petitioners filed an appeal before the District Judge, Multan on 14-6-2003, assailing the judgment and decree of the trial Court. The learned Additional District Judge, Multan vide judgment and decree dated 17-3-2004 dismissed the appeal of the plaintiffs, hence the instant revision petition.\n  4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that both the Courts below committed material illegality in dismissing the suit of the petitioners. Further submits that firstly the plaintiffs-petitioners never gifted the disputed land in favour of the Health Department, Government of the Punjab. Anyhow, in Roznamcha Waqiati Exh. P.4 it is very much mentioned. Even if there was any collusive entry about the gift, even then that was conditional gift mutation that if the dispensary was not constructed the land in dispute would be reverted to the owners of the land.\n  5. On the other hand, the learned Assistant Advocate-General appearing on behalf of the Health Department opposed the contentions of the learned counsel for the plaintiffs-petitioners and vehemently supported the judgments of the two Courts below, and contended that the judgments of both the Courts below are based on record and no illegality or irregularity has been committed by the lower Courts while passing their judgments and decrees.\n  6. I have heard the arguments of the parties and minutely perused the record on the file. In both the Courts below respondents-defendants vehemently asserted that the land in dispute was in their possession. Basic ingredients of gift are offer, acceptance and delivery of possession. No doubt, in the Revenue Record the entry was manipulated that the land in dispute is in possession of the respondents. When the respondents learned counsel was questioned that the possession of the disputed land was with whom, he after getting instructions from the Health Department, Multan replied to the Court that for the last near-about 29 years the physical possession of the land was still with the petitioners-plaintiffs, real owners of the land. The Health Department submitted comments in the instant civil revision in which in paras.2 and 3 it is mentioned that budget was sanctioned during the year, 2004-2005. The District Development Committee held a meeting on 26-10-2004; the District Government has required PC-1 of the development projects to be approved and executed in the current financial year, 2004-2005 from the Health Department. The preparation of PC-1 for establishment of Basic Health Unit a, Bootay Wala, Dispensary at Peer Aolia Jalalpur Pirwala and MCH Centre at Mouza Soman, Tehsil Shujabad, District Multan are under process with the office of respondent No.2 for which the Government land is available. It is unfortunate that till the time of final hearing of the revision petition no steps have been taken to construct and establish the dispensary for the purposes of which land was allegedly gifted by the plaintiffs-petitioners, while the petitioners vehemently denied the execution of gift mutation and delivery of possession. It is very strange that during trial defendants-respondents/Health Department did not file their written statement and the defence was struck off, even then the learned trial Court on its own pleaded the case of the Health Department and dismissed the suit of the plaintiffs-petitioners. Same was situation in the lower appellate Court. The learned Additional District Judge dismissed the appeal of the petitioners-plaintiffs filed against the judgment and decree of the trial Court, although nobody on behalf of the respondents in the lower appellate Court contested the appeal.\n  7. In view of the above discussion, it is held that the physical possession of the disputed land measuring 10 Kanals is still with the plaintiffs-petitioners and physical possession of the said land was never delivered to the respondents-defendants, as such no gift was made in favour of the Health Department, Government of the Punjab. The entries made in the Revenue Record were fictitious, result of collusiveness of the officials of the Revenue Department with the Health Department. For this view I am guided by the dictum laid down in the cases reported as Muhammad Zaman Khan v. The Additional Chief Land Commissioner and another 1986 SCMR 1121, Mian Muhammad Rafiq Saigol v. Trust Modarba 2003 CLD 634, Muhammad Sarwar and 3 others v. Jahangir Ahmad and 5 others 2002 CLD 1865-Lahore (DB), Maula Dad v. Fazal Dad 2002 MLD 1101, Mrs. Saima Khatoon v. Manzar Hussain 1993 MLD 1542-Karachi, and Manzoor Hussain v. Raja Shah and others 1992 CLC 602. In the case of Muhammad Zaman (supra) the Honourable Supreme Court ruled that, \"Ordinarily under the Muslim Law .three requirements for a valid gift are (i) a declaration of gift by the donor (ii) acceptance of the gift express or implied by or on behalf of the donee, and (iii) delivery of possession of the subject-matter of the gift by the donor to the donee.\" In all the other cited cases, same view was taken by High Courts.\n  8. Resultantly, this revision petition is allowed. The suit filed by the petitioners-plaintiffs is decreed. No order as to costs.\n  H.B.T./S-247/L Petition allowed.",

A pedigree table was drawn in para.1 of the plaint. It was stated that the suit house was owned by Noor Zaman who died 20 years ago and the house devolved upon the parties. Mst. Bhag Bhari petitioner No.1 only has 1/11 share in the house. The plaintiffs have 29/66 while the defendants have 31/66. However, Bhag Bhari proceeded to exchange the house with Ghulam Ali, petitioner No.2, and delivered the possession to him vide registered exchange deed dated 14-2-1995. A declaration and decree for separate possession of 29/66 partition was accordingly prayed for. The plea taken by the petitioner-was that the house was not owned by Noor Zaman. It was owned by one Mst. Begum who sold it to Bhag Bhari vide registered sale-deed dated 19-5-1975 and delivered the possession and thereafter Bhag Bhari gave the house to Ghulam Ali petitioner No.2 vide exchange deed dated 14-2-1995. Following issues were framed from time to time by the learned trial Court and parties went on trial.\n  (1) Whether plaintiff is entitled to declaration as prayed for along with possession, if so, to what extent? OPP\n  (1-A) Whether transaction dated 19-5-1975 in favour of defendant is against law and facts and without jurisdiction and is null and void on the rights of plaintiffs? OPP.\n  (2) Whether Mst. Begum was real owner of disputed property and later transaction by her was according to law and facts? OPD\n  (2-A) Whether suit is barred by time? OPD\n  (2-B) Whether suit is incorrectly valued for the purpose of court-fee and jurisdiction? OPD\n  (3) Relief.\n  Evidence of the parties was recorded. The suit was dismissed by the learned trial Court on 14-9-1996. First appeal was allowed by a learned Additional District Judge, Attock on 16-3-1998, who directed the trial Court to frame a specific issue regarding ownership of Noor Zaman. After remand following issues were framed:\n  1-B Whether Noor Zaman predecessor in-interest of the plaintiffs and defendants Nos.1, 3 to 8 was the last owner of the property in dispute and after his death the property devolved on his lawful heirs? OPP\n  2.C. Whether Ghulam Ali defendant No.2 is bona fide transferee of the land with consideration without notice? OPD.\n  Some evidence was recorded. The learned trial Court passed a preliminary decree on 15-12-2000. First appeal filed by the petitioners has been dismissed by a learned Additional District Judge, Attock, on 24-1-2002.\n  2. Before I proceed further I may note here that this civil revision was filed by seven persons mentioned in the memo. of parties. Vide order dated 29-10-2008, the civil revision stands dismissed as withdrawn to the extent of petitioners Nos.1 and 4 to 7 while to the extent of petitioner No.3 it was dismissed for non-prosecution. This hearing is being conducted inter se petitioner No.2 and the respondents.\n  3. Learned counsel for the petitioner No.2 contends that it is a finding recorded by both the courts that there is no evidence of title either of Begum Jan, Bhag Bhari or Noor Zaman. The precise contention in the said state of evidence is that a decree for possession could not have been passed. Relies on the case of Allah Din v. Habib PLD 1982 SC 465. Further contends that this was a case of oath against oath and the plaintiffs were bound to fail. Learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, contends that this is civil litigation and has been decided on preponderance of the evidence.\n  4. I have gone through the copies of the record, with assistance of the learned counsel for the parties. It will be noted that the plaintiffs/respondents had sought possession of the property to the extent of their alleged share on the ground that Noor Zaman was the last male owner of the suit property. This was burden of issue No.1-B. It is true that the defendants were also burdened to prove ownership of Mst. Begum. However, they were already in possession and had not come to the Court for any relief.\n  5. Learned Courts below after holding that claim of Begum Jan that house was transferred to her by husband has not been proved proceeded to hold that Noor Zaman was owner of the property when admittedly there was not an iota of evidence on record in support of issue-l-B regarding ownership of Noor Zaman.\n  6. Under Article 126 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 where a person is in possession the burden to prove that he is not owner is upon person who is seeking possession. The rule emanating from the said statutory provision is that a person in possession can be dispossessed only by a person having a title superior to person who is in possession. There is no proof of any such superior title vesting in the plaintiffs/respondents. Findings recorded by the learned Courts below are that there is no evidence of ownership of Begum Jan, Bhag Bhari and Noor Zaman. In such eventuality rule of inperidelicto would also become effective and the case will have to be decided in favour of person who is in possession. Thus from whatever angle seen impugned judgments and decrees clearly attract mischief of section 115, C.P.C. and cannot be sustained. Civil revision is accordingly allowed. Both the impugned judgments and decrees are set aside and suit of the plaintiffs/respondents dismissed as against petitioner No.2 but without any order as to costs.\n  S.

(C.M.A. No.8619 of 2006) was allowed for the reasons to be recorded later and now I proceed to record the same.\n  Brief facts leading to this application are that this suit was originally filed against three defendants namely Blazon Advertising (Pvt.) Ltd. through its Chairman Mr. Asif Raza Mir (the applicant) (2) Mrs. Uzma Gilani, Director and (3) Mr. Habib Hashmani, Director for Recovery of Rs.4,914,959 being outstanding amount against the defendants on account of a contract dated 31-12-1993 for installation, operation and maintenance of 18 tri-vision Displays at designated sites at Quaid-e-Azam International Airport Karachi and also tri-vision display site each at Lahore and Islamabad 1993 for a period of 5 years. Summonses were issued to the defendants but on account of the fact that office of the defendant No.1 had been shifted, therefore, service on it was effected in substitute manners, and the suit proceeded ex parte and lastly decreed against the defendant No.1 whereas the same was withdrawn against the defendants Nos.2 and 3 on 29-4-2003.\n  The listed C.M.A. was filed on 21-11-2006 by the applicant Asif Raza Mir for setting aside the ex parte decree on the ground that he was never served with the summons. It was further submitted that he was only a Director and the shareholder of the Company known as Blazon (Pvt.) Ltd. and on account of certain serious dispute between the shareholders the Company had suspended 'all its activities and closed out its business in 1998 and he himself left Pakistan and settled in Canada and this fact was in the knowledge of the plaintiff as during pendency of the suit such statement was filed in Court by its Advocate but a wrong and incomplete address was given whereas the suit was filed on 19-9-2000 giving the address of the Company of Karachi, publication of the summons was made in the daily Dawn Karachi on the basis of which service was held good although he was in Canada in those days and returned to Pakistan on 16-10-2006, whereas the suit was decreed ex parte on 31-8-2004 but he came to know about the decree when the notice in the Execution Application No.12 of 2005 was served upon him as Chairman of the judgment-debtor Messrs Blazon Advertising, hence the ex parte decree is fit to be set aside to enable the applicant to defend himself on merits by placing the actual facts before this Court.\n  In support of the application the applicant Asif Raza Mir has filed his Affidavit. In reply of the affidavit one Syed Yousuf Abbas, Airport Manager of the plaintiff filed his counter-affidavit in which he inter alia alleged that applicant/defendant was in the knowledge of the pendency of the suit and the notices were published in the Dawn giving the address which was the same as given by him in the license agreement. Necessary documents in support thereof were also filed. The applicant Asif Raza Mir filed his Affidavit in Rejoinder in which he reiterated the averments made in the affidavit as well as in the application and denied the allegations made in the counter affidavit.\n  I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The learned counsel for the applicant submitted that besides other, facts which have been mentioned in the application, admittedly the plaintiff has himself given the address of the applicant which pertains to Canada but the publication of the summons as made in the newspaper of Pakistan and not of Canada and even the address of Karachi given in the publication was not of the applicant, therefore, he remained unaware about the pendency of the suit, therefore, the ex parte decree passed against him is illegal and may be set aside and he may be added as one of the defendants in his personal capacity to defend the suit.\n  The above arguments were repelled by the learned counsel for the plaintiff who submitted that the summonses were sent to the applicant on the addresses given by him in the agreement which was executed with the plaintiff and no other address was available, therefore, service was rightly effected good on the basis of such publication of the summons in the newspaper, hence, the applicant has no case that the decree against him be set aside, however, he could not reply the arguments that when the applicant was residing in Canada as per his own statement in writing, then why the service was not effected on his address at Canada.\n  I have carefully considered the above argument in the light of the record. From the perusal of the record it transpired that the applicant Asif Raza Mir, who has been shown as Chairman of Messrs Blazon Advertising (Pvt.) Ltd. or even as the Chairman of Blazon Advertising, was not residing in Pakistan when the suit was filed as he stated in the Affidavit against which no particular fact was brought on record to deny the same but the notices were sent to him at the address of Karachi which was also published in the Daily Dawn, Karachi. Whereas the statement of the Advocate for the plaintiff dated 2-1-2003 proves that the plaintiff was in the knowledge of this very fact, therefore, the service on him by way of publication of the summons in such a newspaper was not proper and on the basis of such defective service the suit could not be decreed against him without providing an opportunity to be heard for there is nothing on record that this newspaper i.e. daily Dawn was having circulation in Canada also or the said publication of the summons ever came to his notice in any manner before the decree was passed against him. Even after the publication of the summons in the daily Dawn Karachi dated 20-5-2003 the matter was placed before the Court on 11-8-2003 when directions were issued that the summons to the defendant through bailiff be served. Again the bailiff reported that the defendant had been shifted from the said address and therefore, the plaintiff w-z asked to file fresh address but in place of filing the fresh address on the request of the learned counsel for the plaintiff the matter was fixed in Court on 22-9-2003 on which date on the basis of publication of the earlier summons in daily Dawn dated 20-5-2003 it was ordered that the suit would proceed ex parte.\n  In the above circumstances, it is clear that the ex parte decree passed against the applicant Asif Raza Mir as Chairman of the J.D. is illegal being in violation of the principle of natural justice, therefore the same is set aside. His request that he may also be added as defendant No.2 in his personal capacity is also accepted. J.M.16 of 2007 is also disposed of accordingly. Let the plaintiff file an amended plaint accordingly.\n  M.H./C-23/K Application allowed.",

ALI HASSAN RIZVI, J.--- Muhammad Idrees plaintiff/respondent had filed a civil suit on 10-6-1998 seeking a declaration that he was owner in possession of house built on 4 Marlas situate in Abadi Mauza Ahla, Tehsil and District Mandi Baha-ud-Din and that the defendants Karam Din, . his wife Mst. Aashi, and his two sons Ashfaq Ahmad and Intezar Hussain alias Ahmad Yar, had no right or authority, whatsoever, to interfere with his peaceful possession. As a consequential relief, the defendants were sought to be permanently restrained from casting any clouds on the title of the plaintiff or from interfering with his peaceful possession in any manner, whatsoever. It was averred in para.1 of the plaint that the defendants had two and a quarter years before, taken the afore-said site as Areeat for construction of a Kurh (shed) for tethering the cattle and that a written agreement dated 26-3-1996 was executed between him and defendant No.3, Ashfaq Ahmad.\n  2. The suit was resisted by the defendants/revision petitioners vide their written statement dated 10-3-1999. It was claimed that they had filed a civil suit which was pending in the Court of Mr. Muhammad Shafiq Butt, then learned Civil Judge, Mandi Baha-ud-Din and that the present :.;at was a counterblast. They also pleaded that they were in possession since 1976. As to the afore-mentioned agreement, the execution thereof was denied.\n  3. During the pendency of the suit, Karam Din, defendant No.1 had died and his legal heirs, which are now the revision petitioners were substituted vide amended plaint dated 13-11-1998.\n  4. The learned Civil Judge seized of the suit put the parties on trial on the following issues:---\n  \"Issues:\n  (1) Whether the plaintiff has not come to the Court with clean hands? OPD\n  (2) Whether the plaintiff has filed the suit just to harass the defendants, hence the defendants are entitled to special costs Rs.20,000 under section 35-A of C.P.C.? OPD\n  (3) Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action to file this suit? OPD\n  (4) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree for declaration as prayed for? OPP\n  (5) Relief.\n  5. On conclusion of the trial Mr. Mahmood Azam Warraich, learned Civil Judge Mandi Baha-ud-Din, dismissed the suit vide judgment and decree dated 28-1-2000 mainly on the ground that Muhammad Idrees the plaintiff/respondent was not the owner of the suit property.\n  6. In appeal, the findings recorded by the learned trial Court were reversed and consequently the suit was decreed vide judgment and decree dated 17-12-2004 rendered by Malik Abdul Rasheed, learned Additional District Judge, Mandi Baha-ud-Din.\n  7. The present revision petition was filed on 15-3-2005 to challenge the appellate judgment and decree dated 17-12-2004.\n  8. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record. Issues Nos.1, 3 and 4 being interdependent, may be taken up together. The plaintiff/respondent Muhammad Idrees appeared as P.W. 1 and got exhibited the agreement dated 26-3-1996 as Exh. P. 1. He examined Muhammad Latif, Sub-Engineer P.W.2 who as a local commission had testified his report Exh.P.2 and the site-plan Exh.P.3. Further, Abdul Sattar P.W.3 was also examined who testified the afore-said agreement Exh. P. 1. Muhammad Ramzan P. W .4 was also examined who, too, testified the execution of agreement Exh. P.1.\n  9. On the other hand, Mst. Aashi one of the defendants/revision petitioners appeared as D.W.1. Ashfaq Ahmad, one of the defendants/ revision petitioners appeared as D.W.2. Muhammad Suleman D.W.3 was examined on their behalf.\n  10. The afore-mentioned was the entire evidence on record for and against the parties.\n  11. The case of Muhammad Idrees plaintiff/respondent was mainly based on agreement Exh.P.1. This agreement showed that Ashfaq Ahmad, defendant/petitioner was first cousin (Tayazad) of Muhammad Idrees 'plaintiff/respondent and the site in question was taken as Areeat for two years; that the defendants would raise temporary construction; that after 31-3-1998 they would remove the superstructure and hand over the vacant possession to Muhammad Idrees and that if the terms of the agreement were violated, he would have a right to get the site vacated through lawful means. The execution of this agreement was denied in the written statement. However, I find that the denial was not specific and rather evasive. Such an evasive denial when viewed in terms of Order VIII, rules 4 and 5, C.P.C., the relevant assertion made by the other side, would be deemed to have been admitted.\n  12. It is a settled law that in civil matters when entire evidence is recorded, burden of proof would lose its importance and the Court has to examine the evidence in its entirety. Mst. Aashi Bibi D. W.1 herself admitted that they had earlier filed a suit with regard to the same site in question and that the same was withdrawn with permission to sue afresh. She further admitted that no fresh suit was ever filed by them. She also admitted that when local commission had visited the spot, Muhammad Idrees plaintiff/respondent was in actual physical possession although with a lump and throat, she added that he had taken possession with the\n  help of police. Ashfaq Ahmad D.W.2 claimed in his examination-in-chief that the property in question was owned by Government of Pakistan; that his father was in possession and that he had never executed any Iqrarnama. He claimed that the Iqrarnama relied by the plaintiff/ respondent was a fake document. During cross-examination he was confronted with the written statement. He denied having signed the written statement. However, he admitted his signatures on the front and back side of the agreement Exh.P.1. He also admitted that the I.D. Card number shown thereon related to him. Then he tried to take a shift saying that the stamp paper was got written through fraud. He however, failed to state any particular of the so-called fraud. It is evident that he had admitted the execution of the agreement Exh. P.1 dated 26-3-1996. The agreement Exh.P.1 was fully covered under Article 102 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and any oral evidence against its terms, would stand excluded from consideration vide Article 103 of the Order (ibid).\n  13. As per Article 170 of Principles of Mahomedan Law by Dr. M.A. Manan (Pakistan Edition), an Areeat would be resumable at the grantor's option. \"Areeat\" is investiture with the use of a thing without return. In other words, it signifies simply a licence to use the property of another. In the present case, the Areeat was for a limited period from 26-3-1996 to 31-3-1998 whereafter the grant was resumable at the option of the grantor (Muhammad Idrees). The temporary possession of the defendants was nothing more than permissive under the agreement Exh.P.1 executed on 26-3-1996 for a limited period of two years. Muhammad Idrees plaintiff/respondent even if was not an owner of the site in question, had possessory rights and consequently could maintain a suit on the basis of his legal character. As per section 42 of Specific Relief Act, 1877, any person entitled to any legal character, or to any rights as to any property could maintain a suit for declaration with consequential relief. The term \"legal character\" has a bit different connotation from \"a title to property\". It was proved on record that Muhammad Idrees plaintiff/respondent was in actual physical possession of the property in question before 26-3-1996 when the agreement Exh.P.1 was executed. His possessory rights had conferred on him a legal status, except against the true owner, if any, which is equivalent to legal character as envisaged under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877. \"Stronger is the position of the person who is in possession\" is a time-accepted rule. The term \"legal character\" is familiar to the lawyers. It is, however, difficult to define precisely its connotation within a short compass. The defendants/revision petitioners in this case were bound by the terms of the agreement dated 26-3-1996 Exh.P.1. By denying the execution of the agreement Exh.P.1, in their written statement, the defendants/revision petitioners had cut their size. Its execution was proved during evidence. Section 42 of the Act ibid does not postulate that declaration in respect of right to any property could be sought only by an owner of the same. Hyderabad Municipal Corporation v. Messrs Fateh Jeans Ltd. 1991 MLD 284 maybe relied upon.\n  14. In purview of the evidence and the legal position as discussed above, the plaintiff/respondent could not be dubbed to have come to Court with unclean hands. It could also not be said that he had no valid cause of action. He was, therefore, entitled to the decree for declaration and permanent injunction as prayed for with respect to the property in question. The allegation of the defendants/revision petitioners that Muhammad Idrees had taken forcible possession remained bald leading to no consequence. As a result, I find that the learned Additional District Judge was justified as a superior Court of fact, in reversing the findings recorded by the learned trial Court and had rightly decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff/respondent vide his judgment/decree dated 17-12-2004.\n  15. Now a word about Issue No.2. In purview of findings on issues Nos.1, 2 and 4, there was no warrant to say that the plaintiff/respondent had filed the suit to harass the revision petitioners. There was, therefore, no question of awarding special costs under section 35-A, C.P.C.\n  16. For my own reasons as recorded above, I uphold the judgment/decree dated 17-12-2004 rendered by the learned Additional District Judge, Mandi Baha-ud-Din, decreeing the suit. Consequently, the revision petition is dismissed with costs.\n  17. A copy of this judgment shall be communicated through the District and Sessions Judge concerned to the learned trial Judge as also the learned appellate Judge wherever they are posted.\n  S.A.K./K-32/L Revision dismissed.",

A.-G. for petitioners.\n  Arshad Ch. for Respondents.\n  Date of hearing: 15th May, 2009.\n    JUDGMENT\n  AMANULLAH KHAN YASINZAI, C.J.--- This civil revision under section 115, C.P.C. is directed against the judgment and decree dated 27-9-2007 and 7-6-2008, passed by learned Senior Civil Judge-II, Quetta and Additional District Judge-IV, Quetta respectively, whereby the suit filed by predecessor-in-interest of respondents and respondents 2 and 4 was decreed and the appeal filed by petitioners was dismissed.\n  Concisely, the facts leading to filing of instant petition are that, predecessor-in-interest of respondents and respondents 2 and 4, filed a suit for declaration, consequential relief and permanent injunction, with the averments that, they own agricultural property in Mahal and Mouza Khush Kaba Sariab, Tappa Shadanzai, Tehsil and District Quetta, and adjacent to their lands, there are lands bearing Khata No.80/134 Min bearing Khasra Nos.595 to 706 and 941 and 977 to 1085 (181 Qittas) total measuring 1331 Rods and 0 Pol. The said property was transferred in their name vide Intiqal No.157. The said lands consisted upon small pieces of land adjoining each other and were waste and Barren lands. The predecessor-in-interest of respondents and respondents 2 and 4 came in possession of these lands about 40/50 years back and by spending lacs of Rupees and by endless efforts, they succeeded in developing and converting the lands from barren to cultivable lands. Thereafter the respondents approached the then Deputy Commissioner with the plea that, since they have done \"Nautor\" and have developed the lands and are also paying \"Usher\", therefore, the said lands be transferred in their name. The said plea was accepted and on 22-12-1991, the predecessor -in-interest of respondents and respondents 2 and 4 were recorded as \"Mauroosi Bazgars\" in the record of rights. After the lands were entered in their names, their possession remained undisturbed and in 2000 the predecessor-in-interest of respondents and respondents 2 and 4 came to know that entries in the record of rights have been cancelled from their name and entered in the name of Government of Balochistan. On checking the record, it was revealed that the entries were cancelled in view of the Notification, dated 6th December, 1995 and the Balochistan Cancellation of Illegal Allotments of Land Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the Act of 1996). It was stated that after cancellation of mutation, the respondents had been approaching petitioners, but they refused to reverse the mutation, thus, the above suit was filed, with the following relief:---\n  It is, therefore, prayed that a decree may kindly be passed in favour of plaintiffs and against defendants in the following terms:---\n  (a) Declaring that plaintiffs are the lawfully recorded \"Mauroosi Bazgars\" in possession of lands in dispute.\n  (b) Declaring that order, dated 12-10-2000 whereby defendant No.2 cancelled the Intiqal Nos.157 and 216 is illegal, void and without lawful authority and of no legal effect.\n  (c) Declaring that the Notification No.180-14/93-Rev., dated 6-12-1995 has no application on the revenue entries i.e. Itiqal Nos.157 and 216 of lands in dispute in the names of plaintiffs.\n  (d) By means of consequential relief the revenue entries vide Intiqal Nos.157 and 216 may be directed to be restored.\n  (e) By means of permanent injunction defendants may be directed to refrain from resuming possession of lands in dispute from plaintiffs.\n  (f) Costs of proceedings may also be awarded to plaintiffs against defendants.\n  The suit was contested by petitioners on legal and factual grounds. It was mainly asserted that, mutation was cancelled in view of the Notification dated 6th December, 1995 and the Act of 1996. Out of the pleadings of parties, following issues were framed for determination:---\n  The issues\n  (1) Whether the suit of plaintiffs is not maintainable in view of P.Os. \"1\", \"3\" of W/S?\n  (2) Whether the Notification No.180-14/93 Rev., dated 6-12-1995, applies to lands in dispute and cancellation of allotment of disputed lands from the name of plaintiffs is legal by means of order, dated 19-12-1995, by defendant No.2?\n  (3) Whether plaintiffs are in possession of lands in dispute for last 40/50 years, as Mauroosi Bazgars?\n  (4) Whether plaintiffs are entitled to the(sic)?\n  (5) Relief.\n  The respondents-plaintiffs in support of their plea produced the following witnesses:-\n  P. W.1 Haji Rozi Khan, P.W.2 Ghulam Dastagir, P.W.3 Haji Kamal Khan, P.W.4 Ghulam Qadir, P. W.5 Syed Arshad Ali, Attorney, P.W.6 Bashir Ahmed, P.W.7 Abdul Salam, P.W.8 Amir Jan and P.W.9 Muhammad Siddique.\n  In rebuttal petitioners-defendants examined D. W.1 Abdullah Jan and D. W.2 Muhammad Siddique, Saddar Qanoongo.\n  It may be pointed out that 'initially the suit was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 14-4-2006. Being dissatisfied, the respondents filed an appeal, which came up for hearing before the learned Additional District Judge-IV, Quetta. After hearing arguments, the appeal was partly allowed and case was remanded to trial Court. In the meanwhile the predecessor-in-interest of respondents Pir Zainuddin Agha died, thus the respondents-plaintiffs 1, 3 and 5 to 7 were impleaded in the suit. After remand, the learned Senior Civil Judge-II, Quetta decreed the suit in favour of plaintiffs-respondents vide judgment, dated 27-9-2007. Being aggrieved from the same, the petitioners filed an appeal before the learned District Judge, which was transferred on the file of learned Additional District Judge-IV, Quetta, who vide judgment and decree dated 7-6-2008 dismissed the same. Hence this petition.\n  I have heard Mr. Nasrullah Khan Achakzai, learned Additional Advocate-General for the petitioners and Mr. Arshad Chaudhry, learned counsel for the respondents.\n  Learned Additional Advocate-General contended that; both the Courts below have erred in decreeing the- suit as the case of respondents fell within the four corners of 'Notification dated 5th December, 1995 and the Act of 1996, therefore, in view of the same, the mutation entries were rightly cancelled by the Revenue Department. Learned Additional Advocate-General vehemently argued that the Courts below have misread and misappreciated the evidence on record, and came to a conclusion, which is extraneous to record and further argued that, there are various illegalities and irregularities, on the basis of which the impugned judgment is not sustainable.\n  Learned counsel for the respondents, emphatically argued as under:\n  (A) In the first place, the provisions of the Act of 1996 and the Notification, dated 5th December, 1995, were not applicable to the case of respondents, as the land was not allotted to them, but their names were only entered as \"Mauroosi Bazgars\" in the property in dispute, on the basis of their possession.\n  (B) The cancellation order, dated 12-10-2006 was passed in violation of the principle of natural justice.\n  (C) There are concurrent findings of facts arrived at, after proper appreciation of evidence, thus this Court while exercising powers under section 115, C.P.C. has limited scope to enter into the same, unless there is a jurisdictional defect or the judgments are perverse and based on no evidence.\n  (D) Substantial justice has been done, therefore, this Court may not exercise powers under section 115, C.P.C., as the respondents had developed the land after spending huge amount of money and time and the same were throughout in their possession, thus, they were entitled to retain the same.\n  Coming to the contention of learned Additional Advocate-General regarding cancellation of the land from the name of respondents on the basis of the Notification dated 5th December, 1995 and the provisions of the Act of 1996; it may be observed that, it is the case of respondents, that they were in possession of the land in dispute for last many decades and after spending huge amount, it was developed and turned into a cultivable land. In this regard the statements of P.Ws. are very important. P.W.7 Abdul Salim, Senior Clerk, Irrigation Department produced documents Exhs.P.41 to 48, indicating therein, the amounts deposited for use of bulldozers 'and further names of the drivers are also mentioned, who brought the bulldozers to the land and levelled the same. P.W.8 Amir Jan and P.W.9 Muhammad Siddique tendered documents Exhs.P.49 and 50 and 51 to 57 respectively, indicating the payment of \"Usher\" made by the respondents in respect of the land in dispute. However, D. W.2, Muhammad Siddique tendered document Exh.D.2 which shows that the land in dispute was recorded in the name of respondents. The statement of said witnesses have not been disputed by the petitioner, which shows that the land in dispute was adjacent to the settled lands of respondents, who developed the same, by \"Nautor\" and turned it into cultivable land and then applied for recording their names as \"Mauroosi Bazgars\" thus it was not an abrupt entry in the record of rights and ownership rights were not transferred in the names of respondents, and they were only entered as \"Mauroosi Bazgars\". The contention of learned counsel for respondents has substance that the notification and the Act of 1996, were not applicable to the case of respondents. It would be relevant to refer to section 3 of the Act of 1996, and the operative portion of Notification, which reads as under: --\n  \"Now, therefore, with prior approval of Government of Balochistan and in exercise of powers vested in it, the Board of Revenue, Balochistan hereby directs immediate cancellation of all titles/rights/interests acquired directly or indirectly through the process of settlement work started with effect from Board of Revenue, Balochistan's Notification No.180-14/84-Rev, dated 28-10-1986 and consequently through notification No.180-14/Rev., dated 9-11-1987. This will, however, have no effect on legitimate titles/rights/interests acquired earlier than 28th October, 1986 in respect of all area under settlement operation after the above date and all valid transactions made by land-owners and their successors in interest in respect of lands validly owned by them. The Revenue Record prepared by settlement staff is transferred to Deputy Commissioner/Collector, Quetta District with immediate effect for necessary entries in the relevant record and resumption of State land in accordance with rights and titles in relevant record before issuance of the above said notification.\"\n  As observed hereinabove the land in dispute was not allotted to respondents, but they were only entered as \"Mauroosi Bazgars\" after due process of enquiry.\n  Coming to the next contention of learned counsel for respondents that, after passing of the Notification and the enactment of the Act of 1996, the land in dispute, which was admittedly in possession of respondents, was deliberately cancelled, without giving any notice or initiating enquiry. In view of the fact that the respondents had developed the land in dispute, installed tube-wells, constructed houses for labour, which fact is indicative from the statements of P.Ws.1 to 3, who stated that the respondents were in possession of the land in dispute; since last 40 years; thus it can safely be held that the cancellation order was passed without jurisdiction and in violation of the principle of natural justice.\n  Adverting to the next contention that, since there are concurrent findings of facts arrived at by the Courts below, thus, this Court while exercising revisional jurisdiction under section 115, C.P.C. cannot interfere in the findings of fact. It is a settled principle of law that while exercising powers under section 115, C.P.C., the Court has to satisfy itself that, subordinate Courts had jurisdiction to try. the case and had exercised the same rightly, and that, while exercising jurisdiction, the Court had not acted legally or in breach of any provision of law or with material irregularity, and if the Court is satisfied that the aforesaid criteria has been met with by the Courts below, then the High Court shall not interfere, even if it differs with the findings of subordinate Courts on the question of law or facts. Reference may be made to NS. Venkatagiri Ayyunger's case PLD 1949 PC 26. In my considered opinion, the Courts below have arrived at a conclusion, after proper appreciation of evidence.\n  The only ground agitated by the learned Additional Advocate-General was that mutation entries were cancelled in view of the Notification and the Act of '1996, which contention was rightly repelled by the Courts below, giving cogent reasons for the same, it may be observed that, it is settled principle of law that High Court while sitting in revisional jurisdiction will not interfere in the concurrent findings of facts arrived at by the Courts below, unless it is established that the Courts below have passed the judgment without jurisdiction or have committed material illegality, irregularity or impropriety. Reference may be made to 2005 SCMR 135. Since the learned Additional Advocate-General could not point out any illegality or irregularity committed by the Courts below, thus the findings being unexceptionable do not warrant interference.\n  It may be observed that in the case in hand, the respondents were in possession of the land in dispute and they have developed the same with the passage of time by spending huge amount and applied for entering their names as \"Mauroosi Bazgars\" and the Revenue Authorities after inspection of the land and conducting enquiry, after being satisfied, entered their names as \"Mauroosi Bazgars\" and further, they have been developing the land in question, constructing houses and installing tube-wells, without any objection, thus, the Courts below have done substantial justice, and no interference is called.\n  As a result, the petition being devoid of substance is dismissed leaving the parties to bear their own costs.\n  S.A.K./42/Q Revision dismissed.",

      "case_facts": " Concisely, the facts leading to filing of instant petition are that, predecessor-in-interest of respondents and respondents 2 and 4, filed a suit for declaration, consequential relief and permanent injunction, with the averments that, they own agricultural property in Mahal and Mouza Khush Kaba Sariab, Tappa Shadanzai, Tehsil and District Quetta, and adjacent to their lands, there are lands bearing Khata No.80/134 Min bearing Khasra Nos.595 to 706 and 941 and 977 to 1085 (181 Qittas) total measuring 1331 Rods and 0 Pol. The said property was transferred in their name vide Intiqal No.157. The said lands consisted upon small pieces of land adjoining each other and were waste and Barren lands. The predecessor-in-interest of respondents and respondents 2 and 4 came in possession of these lands about 40/50 years back and by spending lacs of Rupees and by endless efforts, they succeeded in developing and converting the lands from barren to cultivable lands. Thereafter the respondents approached the then Deputy Commissioner with the plea that, since they have done \"Nautor\" and have developed the lands and are also paying \"Usher\", therefore, the said lands be transferred in their name. The said plea was accepted and on 22-12-1991, the predecessor -in-interest of respondents and respondents 2 and 4 were recorded as \"Mauroosi Bazgars\" in the record of rights. After the lands were entered in their names, their possession remained undisturbed and in 2000 the predecessor-in-interest of respondents and respondents 2 and 4 came to know that entries in the record of rights have been cancelled from their name and entered in the name of Government of Balochistan. On checking the record, it was revealed that the entries were cancelled in view of the Notification, dated 6th December, 1995 and the Balochistan Cancellation of Illegal Allotments of Land Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the Act of 1996).",

While the right of divorce is deprecated at all levels, it has nevertheless begrudgedly been granted, to be exercised where a marriage breaks down irretrievably when this happens, law provides a mechanism whereunder the parties are provided an opportunity to reconcile their differences through intermediaries by engaging in the process of reconciliation through arbitrators. However, where such efforts fail, despite lapse of three months, law presumes that reconciliation is not possible and there has been an irretrievable break down. Thereupon the parties are allowed to undo the marriage tie and both parties can walk away, if they so wish with dignity and grace. This is real objective of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, the Family Courts Act, as amended from time to time and the Rules framed thereunder.\n  (b) Administration of justice---\n  ----Laws and rules are not meant to prolong agony of one party or other on basis of technicalities and hairsplitting, such is not intention of law.\n  (c) Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (VIII of 1961)----\n  ----S. 7(1)---West Pakistan Rules under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, R.3(b)---Talaq---Non-service of notice of Talaq---Validity---Such non-service being a mere irregularity would not affect validity of a Talaq validly pronounced and communicated---Principles.\n  The provisions of section 7(1) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 and Rule 3(b) of West Pakistan Rules under the Muslim Laws Ordinance, 1961 are directory in nature as no penalty is provided for their non-compliance. Non-service of notice is a mere irregularity and does not affect validity of a divorce validly pronounced and communicated. The rationale for providing for notice of divorce to be sent to the Union Counsel of the area where the wife resides is to facilitate her participation in the proceedings, if she so desires.\n  Batool Tahir through Nominee/Representative/Special Attorney Mustejab Zehra v.

Muhammad Ameen Javed for Respondent.\n  Date of hearing: 16th November, 2009.\n    ORDER\n  IJAZ UL AHSAN, J.--- This petition arises from proceedings for dissolution of marriage initiated by respondent No.1 against the petitioner. The petitioner and respondent No.1 were married on 27-2-1992 at Lahore. They have two sons and a daughter from the marriage. The marriage could not sustain. According to the petitioner, she was thrown out of the home of the respondent on 11-11-2008. The petitioner has close relatives living in Lahore. The Nikah Nama indicates that she was residing at Model Town, Lahore at the time of her marriage. Presently, one of the petitioner's brother's resides at the said address. The younger brother of he petitioner lives in Eden Canal Villas, Thokar Niaz Beg, Lahore. Yet another brother of the petitioner resides at Army Flats (MOQ), Girja Chowk, Tufail Road, Lahore Cantt.\n  2. It appears from the record that after pronouncement of divorce on the petitioner, respondent No.1 signed and executed a divorce deed on 27-2-1992, which was duly signed and attested by two witnesses. A copy of the divorce deed along with a cover letter was sent to Chairman Arbitration Council No.127 Model Town, Lahore. The said office sent a notice at the aforesaid address. The notice was received by Mr. Hassan Kamran Bashir, who filed an application before the Chairman Arbitration Council Union Council No.127, Model Town, Lahore stating that his sister was residing with her younger brother namely Hassan Danial Bashir at Eden Canal Villas; Thokar Niaz Beg, Lahore.\n  3. While the aforesaid events were occurring, two significant events took place: First, the petitioner filed an application under section 9 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 before Union Council No.119, Shah Pur, District Lahore within whose jurisdiction the property in Eden Canal is situated. The petitioner claimed that at the time of pronouncement of divorce, she was residing at the aforesaid address. The said Union Council has since passed an order directing the respondent to pay a sum of Rs.400,000 per month to the petitioner as maintenance from 11-11-2008 to 10-4-2009. A direction has also been issued that since the amount due has not been paid, the same be recovered from respondent No.1 as arrears of land revenue. The second significant event was that the petitioner filed Writ Petition No.4481 of 2009 on 6-3-2009 alleging that a notice of divorce had been filed by respondent No.1 with Union Council No.127, Model Town, Lahore. Her older brother had informed them that since the petitioner was not residing in Model Town, the said Union Council had no jurisdiction to proceed with the matter. She alleged that despite having passed an order that Union Council 127 Model Town, Lahore had no jurisdiction in the matter, the said Union Council was going to recall its previous order dated 28-1-2009 and was also planning to issue a Talaq Certificate in favour of respondent No.1.\n  4. The petitioner also filed an application before the District Officer (Revenue), Lahore seeking a restraining order against Union Council No.127 from recalling its earlier order. The DOR refused to pass an order on her application on the ground that he had no jurisdiction in the matter. Writ Petition No.4481 of 2009 was contested. However, on a statement made on behalf of Union Council No.127, Model Town, Lahore that the petitioner was not residing within its jurisdiction, that it had no intention of recalling its order in this regard, the learned counsel for the petitioner sought permission to withdraw the petition. The learned counsel representing the respondent submitted that she was earlier residing at Model Town, Lahore and if she had changed her residence, her fresh address should be provided to him so that his client (respondent) may proceed with the matter on the correct and existing address. Mr. Hassan Kamran Bashir, brother of the petitioner, who was present in Court informed this Court that the petitioner was residing at 6-Army Flats (MOQ), Girja Chowk, near PSO Petrol Pump, Tufail Road, Lahore Cantt. It was, therefore, recorded by this Court that the respondent could initiate proceedings in the light of the aforesaid address, if so advised. The petition was accordingly disposed on 22-6-2009.\n  5. Having authentic knowledge of the residential address of the petitioner by way of statement made before this Court by her brother, respondent No.1 issued' a fresh letter dated 2-7-2009. Through the said letter the respondent informed the petitioner that he had divorced her vide divorce deed (Talaq Nama) dated 22-11-2008. He nevertheless pronounced Talaq upon the petitioner once again through the aforesaid letter dated 02-7-2009. The letter, which was witnessed by two persons, was sent to the petitioner at 6-Army Flats (MOQ), Girja Chowk, near PSO Petrol Pump, Tufail Road, Lahore Cantt: This is the same address which was provided by the brother of the petitioner in this Court. Copies of the letter were sent to Chairman Arbitration Council, Lahore Cantonment Board, Lahore Cantt., Hassan Kamran Bashir, real brother of the petitioner at his address in Model Town, Lahore as well as Hassan Danial Bashir brother of the petitioner at WAPDA Town, Lahore.\n  6. The aforesaid notice appears to have been received by the petitioner as well as by respondent No.2. On receipt of the said notice respondent No.2 summoned the petitioner vide order dated 2-7-2009 for 9-7-2009. The order sheet of respondent No.2 indicates that on 9-7-2009, neither the petitioner nor her representative appeared. The record of respondent No.2 indicates that the petitioner was served on 2-7-2009 as is evident from the report of Zaheer Ahmad, Process Server of the Cantonment Board Lahore Cantt. Notices were also sent through ordinary post as well as registered post acknowledgement due. It is not clear from the record whether or not notices sent by post were received by the petitioner. Respondent No.2 nevertheless, vide order dated 9-7-2009, directed that the petitioner be summoned through registered notice and citation in the newspaper. The citation appeared in daily \"Jang\" on 25-7-2009. It is evident from the record that the petitioner had notice of pendency of the proceedings before respondent No.2 as she filed an application for dismissal of the application for issuance of certificate of Talaq on 20-8-2009. The said application is available in the record of respondent No.2, which has been summoned and examined by this Court. In view of the fact that the Chairman Arbitration Council was not available on 20-8-2009, the matter was adjourned to 03-9-2009, where after it was adjourned to 29-9-2009. It is noticed that either respondent No.1 or his duly authorized Arbitrator were available and attended the proceedings on each of the aforementioned dates. Neither the petitioner nor any of her representatives attended the proceedings before respondent No. 2 despite notice.\n  7. On 18-9-2009, the petitioner filed the present petition praying that proceedings before respondent No.2 fegarding issuance of Talaq Certificate in pursuance of application of respondent No.1 may be quashed/set aside as the same were illegal and void ab initio. Vide order dated 18-9-2009, the petition was admitted to regular hearing. Notice was issued to the respondents for 15-10-2009. In the meantime proceedings before respondent No.2 were stayed.\n  8. The main point agitated by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that in terms of section 7 of the Muslim Family Law Ordinance, 1961 read with Rule 3(b) of the West Pakistan Rules under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, respondent No.1 was obliged to send a notice/intimation of divorce to Union Council No.119 Shah Pur within whose jurisdiction, the petitioner was residing at the time the divorce was pronounced. It would be useful to reproduce the provisions of section 7(1) and Rule 3(b), ibid, which read as follows:---\n  Section 7(1).--- Any man who wishes to divorce his wife shall, as soon as may be after the pronouncement of Talaq in any form whatsoever, give the Chairman notice in writing of his having done so, and shall supply a copy thereof to the wife.\n  Rule 3(b).--- The Union Council which shall have jurisdiction in the matter for the purpose of clause (d) of section 2 shall be as follows, namely;\n  (a)\n  (b) in the case of notice of Talaq under subsection (1) of section 7, it shall be the Union Council of the Union or Town where the wife in relation to whom Talaq has been pronounced was residing at the time of the pronouncement of Talaq;\n  Provided that if at the time of pronouncement of Talaq such wife was not residing in any part of West Pakistan, the Union Council that shall have jurisdiction shall be--\n  (i) in case such wife was at any time residing with the person pronouncing the Talaq in any part of West Pakistan, the Union Council of the Union or Town where such wife so last resided with such person; and\n  (ii) in any other case, the Union Council of the Union or Town where the person pronouncing the Talaq is permanently residing in West Pakistan;\n  9. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that a combined reading of section 7(1) and Rule 3(b) makes it abundantly clear that notice of divorce is required to be served on Union Council of Union or Town where the wife in relation to whom Talaq has been pronounced was residing at the time of pronouncement of Talaq. It is further submitted that if it is held that Union Council Shah Pur has no jurisdiction in the matter, the decree passed in favour of the respondent shall be rendered null and void. When confronted with the order of this Court dated 22-6-2009, which was not challenged anywhere, the learned counsel submits that jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent and points out that if jurisdiction vested in Union Council Shah Pur, the same could not by consent of parties be shifted to Union Council Cantonment.\n  10. The learned counsel for the respondent No.1, on the other hand, points out that he exercised his right to divorce the petitioner on 22-11-2008. He has since then been entangled in a prolonged round of litigation on the basis of one technicality or another. He submits that it was in order to set the matter at rest once and for all, that the address of the place of residence of the petitioner was requested to be incorporated in the order of this Court on 22-6-2009 and the respondent was allowed by this Court to initiate proceedings in light of the aforesaid address. Pursuant to order dated 22-6-2009, the respondent No.1 pronounced a fresh Talaq on 2-7-2009, sent the document to the petitioner, her two brothers as well as to respondent No.2. He further submits that requirements of section 7(1) and Rule 3(b) ibid are directory and not mandatory in nature, in view of, the fact that no penalty has been provided in the event of violation of the same. Reliance is placed on Batool Tahir through Nominee/Representative/Special Attorney Mustejab Zehra v. Province of Sindh through Secretary Local Government Sindh and 3 others PLD 2005 Karachi 358, Allah Dad v. Mukhtar and another 1992 SCMR 1273 and Mst. Zahida Shaheen and another v. The State and other 1994 SCMR 2098.\n  11. It is further pointed out that even if for the sake of argument and without conceding, it is admitted that the petitioner was residing within the jurisdiction of Union Council Shah Pur at the time of pronouncement of divorce, the same stood superceded by subsequent pronouncement on 2-7-2009, notice of which was sent at the address provided by the petitioner in this Court, as incorporated in order dated 22-6-2009.\n  12. The learned counsel further submits that the principle that jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent relates only to pecuniary jurisdiction. However, in matters involving family disputes, the jurisdiction can be conferred by the consent of the parties, especially in the present case such jurisdiction stood conferred with consent by reason of order dated 22-6-2009.\n  13. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length. I have also examined the record including the original record relating to this matter produced by respondent No.2. Responding No.1 had pronounced divorce on the petitioner on 22-11-2008. The requisite notice/intimation were sent to Union Council No.127 Model Town, Lahore. On receipt of a notice, a brother of the petitioner informed the Chairman Arbitration Council U.C.No127 that the petitioner was not residing at the said address. He provided a fresh address to the said Union Council i.e. 116-Eden Canal Villas Thokar Niaz Beg, Lahore. It is, however, evident that the petitioner had notice of pronouncement of divorce on 271-2009, when her real brother namely Hassan Kamran Bashir moved an application with the Chairman Arbitration Council U. C.No.127 and provided him the aforesaid information.\n  14. Subsequently, she initiated proceedings for recovery of maintenance before U.C. No.119 Shah Pur on 28-2-2009. While the matter was still in limbo Writ Petition No.4481 of 2009 was filed on 6-3-2009. The said petition finally came up for hearing on 22-6-2009, when the aforesaid order was passed, in which the petitioner's real brother namely Hassan Kamran Bashir provided her residential address at Army Flats (MOQ) Girja Chowk near PSO Petrol Pump Tufail Road, Lahore. It is significant to note that this Court recorded in its order that the respondent could initiate proceedings in light of the aforesaid address, if so advised. No objection to the said order was taken on behalf of the petitioner. Further the aforesaid order was not challenged anywhere and has therefore, attained finality.\n  15. On the basis of the aforesaid order, respondent No.1 pronounced divorce again and intimated the petitioner regarding the same through a written communication dated 2-7-2009. As mentioned above, the said document was sent to the petitioner, her two brothers as well as to respondent No.2. It is not the case of the petitioner that the said document was not received. Her only objection to the same is that in terms of provisions of law mentioned above i.e. section 7(1) and Rule 3(b), subsequent pronouncement of divorce and the service of notice at her current address, are of no legal effect, because these were required to be filed with Union Council Shah Pur, because she was residing within the jurisdiction of said Union Council when the divorce was earlier pronounced.\n  16. It is apparent from the admitted facts of this case that the petitioner has changed her place of residence a few times. Therefore, the fact that the place of resident and address of the petitioner was provided by her real brother to this Court, which was incorporated in the order dated 22-6-2009, is of vital importance in this lis. On the faith of the information provided on this Court and the observation made by, this Court, respondent No.1 proceeded to take steps including pronouncement of divorce afresh and sent intimation to all concerned including the petitioner, her two brothers and respondent No.2. In my opinion, the present petitioner is yet another attempt on the part of the petitioner to delay what has unfortunately become inevitable. It is indeed an unfortunate event in family relationships, when the marriage breaks down. While the right of divorce is deprecated at all levels, it has nevertheless begrudgedly been granted, to be exercised where a marriage breaks down irretrievable, as appears to be the case here. When this happens, law provides a mechanism whereunder the parties are provided an opportunity to reconcile their differences through intermediaries by engaging in the process of reconciliation through arbitrators. However, where such efforts fail, despite lapse of three months, law presumes that reconciliation is not possible and there has been an irretrievable break down. Thereupon the parties are allowed to undo the marriage tie and both parties can walk away, if they so wish with dignity and grace. This, to my mind, is the real objective of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, The Family Courts Act, as amended from time to time and the Rules framed thereunder. Laws and the rules are not meant to prolong the agony of one party or the other on the basis of technicalities and hairsplitting, such is not the intention of law.\n  17. The provisions of section 7(1) and Rule 3(b) are directory in nature as no penalty is provided for their non-compliance. It has been held that non-service of notice is a mere irregularity and does not affect validity of a divorce validly pronounced and communicated. The rationale for providing for notice of divorce to be sent to the Union Council of the area where the wife resides is to facilitate her participation in the proceedings, if she so desires. This purpose, under the facts and circumstances of the present case was adequately served, by service of notice at her current address and the Union Council of the area where she is presently residing, which has taken cognizance of the matter. It is not her case that she has not been served or does not have notice. Even otherwise she is sopped from taking any other position at this stage, having provided her current address during proceedings before this Court. She did not challenge the order dated 22-6-2009 passed by this Court which clearly stated that the \"Respondents can initiate proceedings in light of the above address\". The said order has attained finality.\n  18. The divorce pronounced on 2-7-2009 was validly pronounced if one were to look at the case from a purely technical point of view. It was pronounced thrice in the presence of witnesses. It was duly communicated to the petitioner at the address provided by her where she was admittedly residing at the time the said divorce was pronounced. Intimation was sent to respondent No.2, who has since initiated proceedings and to the information provided to this Court, the requisite period of 90 days has expired on 29-9-2009. The petitioner had ample notice and opportunity to participate in arbitration proceedings, which she chose not to attend. There is neither lawful reason nor justification at this stage to quash or set aside the proceedings before respondent No.2 or to restrain the said respondent from issuing the requisite certificate on expiry of 90 days.\n  19. In view of what has been stated above, I do not find any force in this petition. It is accordingly dismissed.\n  S.A.K./P-38/L Petition dismissed.",

      "case_proceddings": "  2. It appears from the record that after pronouncement of divorce on the petitioner, respondent No.1 signed and executed a divorce deed on 27-2-1992, which was duly signed and attested by two witnesses. A copy of the divorce deed along with a cover letter was sent to Chairman Arbitration Council No.127 Model Town, Lahore. The said office sent a notice at the aforesaid address. The notice was received by Mr. Hassan Kamran Bashir, who filed an application before the Chairman Arbitration Council Union Council No.127, Model Town, Lahore stating that his sister was residing with her younger brother namely Hassan Danial Bashir at Eden Canal Villas; Thokar Niaz Beg, Lahore.\r\n  3. While the aforesaid events were occurring, two significant events took place: First, the petitioner filed an application under section 9 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 before Union Council No.119, Shah Pur, District Lahore within whose jurisdiction the property in Eden Canal is situated. The petitioner claimed that at the time of pronouncement of divorce, she was residing at the aforesaid address. The said Union Council has since passed an order directing the respondent to pay a sum of Rs.400,000 per month to the petitioner as maintenance from 11-11-2008 to 10-4-2009. A direction has also been issued that since the amount due has not been paid, the same be recovered from respondent No.1 as arrears of land revenue. The second significant event was that the petitioner filed Writ Petition No.4481 of 2009 on 6-3-2009 alleging that a notice of divorce had been filed by respondent No.1 with Union Council No.127, Model Town, Lahore. Her older brother had informed them that since the petitioner was not residing in Model Town, the said Union Council had no jurisdiction to proceed with the matter. She alleged that despite having passed an order that Union Council 127 Model Town, Lahore had no jurisdiction in the matter, the said Union Council was going to recall its previous order dated 28-1-2009 and was also planning to issue a Talaq Certificate in favour of respondent No.1.\r\n  4. The petitioner also filed an application before the District Officer (Revenue), Lahore seeking a restraining order against Union Council No.127 from recalling its earlier order. The DOR refused to pass an order on her application on the ground that he had no jurisdiction in the matter. Writ Petition No.4481 of 2009 was contested. However, on a statement made on behalf of Union Council No.127, Model Town, Lahore that the petitioner was not residing within its jurisdiction, that it had no intention of recalling its order in this regard, the learned counsel for the petitioner sought permission to withdraw the petition.

It was, therefore, recorded by this Court that the respondent could initiate proceedings in the light of the aforesaid address, if so advised. The petition was accordingly disposed on 22-6-2009.\r\n  5. Having authentic knowledge of the residential address of the petitioner by way of statement made before this Court by her brother, respondent No.1 issued' a fresh letter dated 2-7-2009. Through the said letter the respondent informed the petitioner that he had divorced her vide divorce deed (Talaq Nama) dated 22-11-2008. He nevertheless pronounced Talaq upon the petitioner once again through the aforesaid letter dated 02-7-2009. The letter, which was witnessed by two persons, was sent to the petitioner at 6-Army Flats (MOQ), Girja Chowk, near PSO Petrol Pump, Tufail Road, Lahore Cantt: This is the same address which was provided by the brother of the petitioner in this Court. Copies of the letter were sent to Chairman Arbitration Council, Lahore Cantonment Board, Lahore Cantt., Hassan Kamran Bashir, real brother of the petitioner at his address in Model Town, Lahore as well as Hassan Danial Bashir brother of the petitioner at WAPDA Town, Lahore.\r\n  6. The aforesaid notice appears to have been received by the petitioner as well as by respondent No.2. On receipt of the said notice respondent No.2 summoned the petitioner vide order dated 2-7-2009 for 9-7-2009. The order sheet of respondent No.2 indicates that on 9-7-2009, neither the petitioner nor her representative appeared.

The main point agitated by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that in terms of section 7 of the Muslim Family Law Ordinance, 1961 read with Rule 3(b) of the West Pakistan Rules under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, respondent No.1 was obliged to send a notice/intimation of divorce to Union Council No.119 Shah Pur within whose jurisdiction, the petitioner was residing at the time the divorce was pronounced.

Pursuant to order dated 22-6-2009, the respondent No.1 pronounced a fresh Talaq on 2-7-2009, sent the document to the petitioner, her two brothers as well as to respondent No.2. He further submits that requirements of section 7(1) and Rule 3(b) ibid are directory and not mandatory in nature, in view of, the fact that no penalty has been provided in the event of violation of the same. Reliance is placed on Batool Tahir through Nominee/Representative/Special Attorney Mustejab Zehra v.

I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length. I have also examined the record including the original record relating to this matter produced by respondent No.2. Responding No.1 had pronounced divorce on the petitioner on 22-11-2008. The requisite notice/intimation were sent to Union Council No.127 Model Town, Lahore. On receipt of a notice, a brother of the petitioner informed the Chairman Arbitration Council U.C.No127 that the petitioner was not residing at the said address. He provided a fresh address to the said Union Council i.e. 116-Eden Canal Villas Thokar Niaz Beg, Lahore. It is, however, evident that the petitioner had notice of pronouncement of divorce on 271-2009, when her real brother namely Hassan Kamran Bashir moved an application with the Chairman Arbitration Council U. C.No.127 and provided him the aforesaid information.\r\n  14. Subsequently, she initiated proceedings for recovery of maintenance before U.C. No.119 Shah Pur on 28-2-2009. While the matter was still in limbo Writ Petition No.4481 of 2009 was filed on 6-3-2009. The said petition finally came up for hearing on 22-6-2009, when the aforesaid order was passed, in which the petitioner's real brother namely Hassan Kamran Bashir provided her residential address at Army Flats (MOQ) Girja Chowk near PSO Petrol Pump Tufail Road, Lahore. It is significant to note that this Court recorded in its order that the respondent could initiate proceedings in light of the aforesaid address, if so advised. No objection to the said order was taken on behalf of the petitioner. Further the aforesaid order was not challenged anywhere and has therefore, attained finality.\r\n  15. On the basis of the aforesaid order, respondent No.1 pronounced divorce again and intimated the petitioner regarding the same through a written communication dated 2-7-2009. As mentioned above, the said document was sent to the petitioner, her two brothers as well as to respondent No.2. It is not the case of the petitioner that the said document was not received. Her only objection to the same is that in terms of provisions of law mentioned above i.e. section 7(1) and Rule 3(b), subsequent pronouncement of divorce and the service of notice at her current address, are of no legal effect, because these were required to be filed with Union Council Shah Pur, because she was residing within the jurisdiction of said Union Council when the divorce was earlier pronounced.\r\n  16. It is apparent from the admitted facts of this case that the petitioner has changed her place of residence a few times. Therefore, the fact that the place of resident and address of the petitioner was provided by her real brother to this Court, which was incorporated in the order dated 22-6-2009, is of vital importance in this lis. On the faith of the information provided on this Court and the observation made by, this Court, respondent No.1 proceeded to take steps including pronouncement of divorce afresh and sent intimation to all concerned including the petitioner, her two brothers and respondent No.2. In my opinion, the present petitioner is yet another attempt on the part of the petitioner to delay what has unfortunately become inevitable. It is indeed an unfortunate event in family relationships, when the marriage breaks down. While the right of divorce is deprecated at all levels, it has nevertheless begrudgedly been granted, to be exercised where a marriage breaks down irretrievable, as appears to be the case here. When this happens, law provides a mechanism whereunder the parties are provided an opportunity to reconcile their differences through intermediaries by engaging in the process of reconciliation through arbitrators. However, where such efforts fail, despite lapse of three months, law presumes that reconciliation is not possible and there has been an irretrievable break down. Thereupon the parties are allowed to undo the marriage tie and both parties can walk away, if they so wish with dignity and grace. This, to my mind, is the real objective of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, The Family Courts Act, as amended from time to time and the Rules framed thereunder. Laws and the rules are not meant to prolong the agony of one party or the other on the basis of technicalities and hairsplitting, such is not the intention of law.\r\n  17. The provisions of section 7(1) and Rule 3(b) are directory in nature as no penalty is provided for their non-compliance. It has been held that non-service of notice is a mere irregularity and does not affect validity of a divorce validly pronounced and communicated. The rationale for providing for notice of divorce to be sent to the Union Council of the area where the wife resides is to facilitate her participation in the proceedings, if she so desires. This purpose, under the facts and circumstances of the present case was adequately served, by service of notice at her current address and the Union Council of the area where she is presently residing, which has taken cognizance of the matter. It is not her case that she has not been served or does not have notice. Even otherwise she is sopped from taking any other position at this stage, having provided her current address during proceedings before this Court. She did not challenge the order dated 22-6-2009 passed by this Court which clearly stated that the \"Respondents can initiate proceedings in light of the above address\". The said order has attained finality.",

Sheikh for Petitioner.\n  Ijaz Ahmad Chadhar for Respondents Nos. 1 to 3.\n  Imtiaz Ahmad Wahga for Respondent No.4.\n    ORDER\n  SYED MANSOOR ALI SHAH, J.-- Brief facts of the case are that respondent No.1 filed a suit for partition, declaration and permanent injunction arraying he petitioner as one of the defendants. The respondents are the real sisters of the petitioner. Respondent No.1 has sought partition, inter alia, of House No.969-B, Faisal Town, Lahore.\n  2. The petitioner filed his written statement on 7-7-2004, thereafter two applications for amendment were moved by defendants Nos.1 and 2 in the suit i.e. petitioner and respondent No.4 for amendment of their written statements under Order VI, rule 17,. C.P.C. on 18-12-2008.\n  3. The amendment by the petitioner was sought on the ground that a suit for specific performance filed by one Muhammad Sohail Irshad against the predecessor-in-interest of the parties which was settled on 22-9-2007 by the petitioner and respondent No.4 by making the payment of Rs.1 million to Muhammad Suhail Irshad. The suit was accordingly dismissed and possession of the house in question was delivered to the petitioner and respondent No.4.\n  4. The application for amendment proposes amendments to para 3 of the written statement as well as addition on para 3A.\n  5. The amendment proposed in para. 3 related to property tax payable on the house. The petitioner has claimed entitlement to receive expenses on account of maintenance of the house and utility facilities, payment of property tax and half of the amount i.e. Rs.500,000 paid by him to Muhammad Sohail Irshad for the settlement of the suit discussed above.\n  6. Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the proposed amendments do not change the nature of the suit and, therefore, should have been allowed under Order VI, rule 17, C.P.C. He further submitted that due to subsequent events i.e. the settlement of the suit for specific performance on 22-9-2007 the written statement filed on 7-7-2004 required amendment as it pertained to a fresh liability pertaining to the property, which was the subject-matter of the suit for partition. He further argued that in a matter of partition both the assets and liabilities are partitioned, thereafter, property tax and other liabilities have to be brought into the corpus of the property, which is to be partitioned.\n  7. Counsel for respondent No.4' while supporting the counsel for the petitioner submitted that it is a well-settled principle that the liabilities pertaining to the property should also be partitioned along with the asset.\n  8. Counsel for respondents Nos.2 and 3 submitted that he was not party to the settlement dated 22-9-2007 and, therefore, the liability of rupees one million cannot be considered to be a joint liability, therefore, the same cannot be subject-matter of the suit for partition. He vehemently supported the impugned order and opposed the amendment of the written statement.\n  9. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record.\n  10. The question of law that emerges in this case is \"whether in a suit for partition, the liabilities relating or attached to the property under partition can also be partitioned/apportioned amongst the legal heirs? And whether a defendant in a suit for partition can claim `Set off?\".\n  11. Exploring Partition Act, 1893 and Order XX, rules 18 and 19 of C.P.C. furnish an answer to the above question. In the commentary to the Partition Act, 1893 cases in India have considered that assets and liabilities both have to be considered at the time of partition. Reference is made to Law relating to Partition by M.N. Das Sixth Edition, Eastern Law house. Under the Chapter on Joint Liabilities, the following has been mentioned:---\n  \"In deciding a case from Lahore in respect of certain debts left by the father of a Mitakshara joint family the Privy Council held antecedent debts of the father so far as they are not illegal or immoral are a liability of the joint estate. They do not merely give rise to a pious obligation on the sons not to object to alienation of the joint estate by the father for such debts. When, however, the family estate is divided it is necessary to take account of both the assets and the debts for which the undivided estate is liable.\"\n  12. Partition Act, 1893 is silent about partition or apportioning of liabilities attached to the subject-matter of partition.\n  13. Order XX, rule 18 and rule 19 provide the elasticity and feasibility to jurisprudentially advance further in answering the above question.\n  \"(18) Decree in suit for portion of property or separate possession of a share therein.---Where the Court passes a decree for the partition of property or for the separate possession of a share therein then, -\n  (1)\n  (2) if and insofar as such decree relates to any other immovable property or to movable property the Court may, if partition or separation cannot be conveniently made without further inquiry pass a preliminary decree declaring the rights of the several parties interested in the property and giving such further directions as may be required.\"\n  14. Reference to the underlined portion of the definition allows the Court to consider the rights of the parties interested in the property. The payments made by the petitioner are directly connected to the property and creates the right of the petitioner in the property. The rights under Order XX, rule 18, C.P.C. need not be limited to rights in the corpus of the property in a physical sense alone but can also include rights in the shape of claims or liabilities or payments made to upkeep the property or payments made to settle the debt of the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioner who already owned the property before it devolved on the children. All such payments constitute \"property\" and need to be apportioned at the time of partition. Another way of looking at the matter is provided in section 4 of the Partition Act, 1893 where sale of the property can be made in case the property is not divisible. Surely at the time of such a sale all the debts attached to the property are to be settled first. So if at the time of sale of debts/claims attached to the property can be considered, why the same principle cannot apply at the time of partition of the property. Claims cannot be limited to the third party only. One of the co-sharers can also have a claim on the property which is required to be settled or set off at the time of partition like any other claim.\n  15. Order XX, rule 9, C.P.C. provides the facility of \"equitable set off\" as opposed to \"legal set off\" which is provided in Order VIII, rule 6, C.P.C. Order XX, rule 19, C.P.C. provides:---\n  \"19. Decree when set off is allowed.---(1) Where the defendant has been allowed a set-off against the claim of the plaintiff, the decree shall state what amount is due to the plaintiff and what amount is due to the defendant, and shall be for the recovery of any sum which appears to be due to either party.\n(2) .\n(3) The provisions of this rule shall apply whether the set-off is admissible under rule 6 of Order VIII or otherwise.\"\n  16. Equitable set off has been recognized by the Courts. In PLD 1971 Supreme Court 162 it was held that equitable set off applied to cases of pre-emption. Justice Wahiduddin Ahmed, J. writing the judgment in the above case note:\n  \"The doctrine of equitable set-off has also been applied in suits for specific performance of contract and suits for redemption. In the case of Brijnath Dass v. Juggernath Dass (1) the right to set-off the costs due to the plaintiff against the amount due by him was recognized in a redemption suit. It was held in that case that the plaintiff was entitled to redemption on paying the amount directed less the costs awarded to him. This principle was further applied by the Madras High Court in the case of Chinanammal v. Chidambara Khothanar (2). In that case, the trial Court passed the decree that on the plaintiff's depositing into Court a certain sum within a fixed time the defendant was to execute a deed of conveyance in his favour. It was further directed that the defendant was to pay the plaintiff a certain amount by way of costs. The plaintiff deposited a sum of money after deducing the amount of costs payable to him under the decree. On these facts it was held by the Madras High Court that the doctrine of equitable set-off was applicable and the plaintiff deposited the proper amount in Court.\n  In the light of the above discussion, I am of the view that the claims of the appellants in respect of the purchase-money and the respondents in respect of the costs are in the nature of cross demands arising out of the same transaction and the doctrine of equitable set-off as applied by the Allahabad High Court in suits of pre-emption is fully applicable to such cases. This view has been firmly established and I am not inclined to upset it after a lapse of about 80 years.\"\n  17. Justice Zafar Hussain Mirza, J. in PLD 1983 SC 5 noted:---\n  \"Order XX, rule 19 is a further statutory recognition of the right of a defendant to plead an equitable set off and obtain relief thereon.\"\n  18. It is sub-rule (13) of Order XX, rule 19 that provides the requisite elasticity to extend equitable set off in new area. Equitable set off will be applied where it appears to the Court that it is equitable to allow set off.\n  19. Needless to say that it must pertain to the same transaction. It, however, does not matter if the amount is ascertained or unascertained. In this case, however, the payments made by the petitioner are ascertained. In the present case, it will be odd. that a suit for partition is limited to the physical partition of the property without factoring in the liabilities attached to the said property. It cannot be the policy of law to encourage protracted litigation and subject the parties to another fresh round of litigation for recovering their claims relating to the property partitioned when all the claims arising from the property under partition can be dealt with in the suit for partition.\n  20. If similar claims can be dealt with in a suit for administration, I see no reason why claims/liabilities attached and fixed to the property in question cannot be apportioned between the parties in a suit for partition. I, therefore, hold that suit for partition includes all the liabilities/claims attached to the said property which will be apportioned and divided as an equitable set off in the suit for partition. In fact, the concept of preliminary inquiry under Order XX, rule 18, CPC seems to be just the right construct for this purpose. The amendment proposed in the petition, therefore, do not change the nature of the suit and can, therefore, be allowed. Delay does not matter as argued by he counsel for the respondent as the aforementioned claims/liabilities have arisen during the pendency of the suit.\n  21. Learned trial Court has not correctly applied the law and, therefore, order dated 13-1-2009 suffers from an illegality. The said order is, therefore, set aside and the amendments proposed by the petitioner are allowed under Order VI, rule 17 of the C.P.C.\n  M.H./G-125/L Revision allowed.\n ",

On these facts it was held by the Madras High Court that the doctrine of equitable set-off was applicable and the plaintiff deposited the proper amount in Court.\n  In the light of the above discussion, I am of the view that the claims of the appellants in respect of the purchase-money and the respondents in respect of the costs are in the nature of cross demands arising out of the same transaction and the doctrine of equitable set-off as applied by the Allahabad High Court in suits of pre-emption is fully applicable to such cases. This view has been firmly established and I am not inclined to upset it after a lapse of about 80 years.\"\n  17. Justice Zafar Hussain Mirza, J. in PLD 1983 SC 5 noted:---\n  \"Order XX, rule 19 is a further statutory recognition of the right of a defendant to plead an equitable set off and obtain relief thereon.\"\n  18. It is sub-rule (13) of Order XX, rule 19 that provides the requisite elasticity to extend equitable set off in new area. Equitable set off will be applied where it appears to the Court that it is equitable to allow set off.\n  19. Needless to say that it must pertain to the same transaction. It, however, does not matter if the amount is ascertained or unascertained. In this case, however, the payments made by the petitioner are ascertained. In the present case, it will be odd. that a suit for partition is limited to the physical partition of the property without factoring in the liabilities attached to the said property. It cannot be the policy of law to encourage protracted litigation and subject the parties to another fresh round of litigation for recovering their claims relating to the property partitioned when all the claims arising from the property under partition can be dealt with in the suit for partition.\n  20. If similar claims can be dealt with in a suit for administration, I see no reason why claims/liabilities attached and fixed to the property in question cannot be apportioned between the parties in a suit for partition. I, therefore, hold that suit for partition includes all the liabilities/claims attached to the said property which will be apportioned and divided as an equitable set off in the suit for partition. In fact, the concept of preliminary inquiry under Order XX, rule 18, CPC seems to be just the right construct for this purpose. The amendment proposed in the petition, therefore, do not change the nature of the suit and can, therefore, be allowed. Delay does not matter as argued by he counsel for the respondent as the aforementioned claims/liabilities have arisen during the pendency of the suit.\n",

Defence No.1 in the original Court is present respondent No.2 and the present applicant was defendant No.3. It was stated in the plaint that defendant No.2, Rashid Ali purchased Plot No.A-133, Sector. T, Sub-Sector I, Gulshane-e-Maymar from defendant No.3, the present applicant. The present applicant was alleged to have told the plaintiff that he was attorney of the said Rashid Ali and then agreed to sale of the said property to the plaintiff. Consequently plaintiff moved an application before the present respondent No.2 for transfer of the suit property in his name but the present respondent No.2 raised objection on the grounds i.e. seller and purchaser must appear in person. Plaintiff alleged that he approached defendant for completion of requisite formalities but defendant parried on one account or the other. Consequently plaintiff filed the suit with the following prayers:--\n  \"(a) Specific performance of the contact to direct the defendants Nos.2 and 3 to perform his part as per sale agreement dated 5-7-2001 to execute sale deed/mutation/sufficient instruments of Plot No.A-133, Sector T, Sub-Sector-I, Gulshan- e-Maymar, measuring 240 sq.yds in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the suit property and also other part of the contract.\nOR\n  Alternate to pass judgment and decree at the present market value price of the suit property in favour of the plaintiff against the defendants for the date of the suit till its utilization.\n  (b) Alternatively to direct the Nazir of this honourable Court to execute the sale-deed or sufficient instruments of sub-lease of. the suit property in favour of the plaintiff before the defendant No.1 and perform the specific part of the contract on behalf of the defendants Nos.2 and 3 including the execution of sufficient instruments in favour of the plaintiff.\n  (c) Permanent injunction, restraining the defendants, their agents, servants, executants, administrators, legal heirs and any other person or person(s) acting on their behalf from creating third party interest encumbering, creating any charge and lien, transferring and dispossessing in any manner of whatsoever of the suit property accept in due course of suit.\n  (d) Cost of the suit.\n  (e) Any other relief(s) which this honourable Court may deem fit and proper under the circumstances of the case.\"\n  The Senior Civil Judge vide Judgment dated 01-2-2006 and decree dated 6-2-2006 decreed the suit. Being aggrieved by the Judgment and decree Civil Appeal bearing No.63 of 2006 was filed.\n  Appeal was adjourned from date to date. On 25-8-2006 appeal was dismissed for non-prosecution. Application under Order XLI rule 19 read with section 151, C.P.C. for re-admission/restoration of the appeal was filed. It is stated in the application that in the early morning of 25-8-2006 Advocate suffered high fever due to which he could neither appear before the Court nor informed the appellant nor could send an application for adjournment to the Court. This application for restoration of application for restoration of appeal was dismissed on 3-2-2007. On 3-2-2007 application came up for first time in the morning and was adjourned to 11-00 a.m. for hearing. At 11-00 a.m. it was dismissed for non-prosecution. At 1-00 p.m. application for restoration of application under Order XLI, rule 19, C.P.C. was filed. It was stated in the application that on 3-2-2007 matter was fixed for service of application under Order XLI, rule 19, C.P.C. and therefore it could not be dismissed for non-appearance of the appellant's Advocate. It was further stated that Advocate for the appellant was present in the earlier hours and his presence was marked in the cause list. It is further stated that in any case the application for restoration had been filed on the same date. This application was dismissed by Appellate Court vide order dated 2-11-2007. Being aggrieved by the order, this revision application has been filed.\n  Learned counsel for applicant made the following submissions:-\n  (1) That the matter on 19-1-2007 was adjourned to 3-2-2007 for service upon the present respondents in respect of application under Order XLI, rule 19, C.P.C.\n  (2) That on 3-2-2007 hearing of application could not have taken place. This revision application was dismissed vide order dated 24-9-2008, an application for restoration of revision application was filed and was decided vide order dated 22-11-2008. In the order restoring the application, the High Court observed that the matter had been fixed for order and not for hearing and on this ground application for restoration was allowed. Learned counsel relied upon Ahmed Nawaz and 4 others v. Abdul Khalique and 13 others 2002 MLD 1783 and Ghulam Fareed v. Shahid-ud-Din Toghalaq, PLD 2008 Kar. 536.\n  Learned counsel for the respondent made the following submissions:\n  (1) Since application under Order XLI, rule 19, C.P.C, had been dismissed it is appealable order under Order XLIII, rule 1(t), C.P.C. and therefore, revision is not maintainable.\n  (2) That since one application for restoration had been dismissed, no second application for restoration could be filed and the matter had become res judicate. He relied upon Faqir Alam and 10 others v. Ajab Khan and 15 others, 1986 CLC 1320.\n  (3) That there were three Advocates in whose favour Vakalatama had been executed, at least one of them should have been present.\n  (4) That fur service means for hearing and when matter was called at 11-00 a.m. no one was present for the present applicant. He relied upon Zahid Ahmad v. Deputy Director Adjudication and 2 others PLD 2006 Kar. 252, Zaheeruddin v. Hashmatullah 1986 CLC 2609, Sindh Sugar Corporation Limited v. Messrs Maqbool Associates, Karachi, 2008 SCMR 47, Muhammad Ashfaq v. Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan, 2000 CLC 1760, Syed Junaid Akhtar and others v. Managing Director/Chairman, PLD 2008 SC 130, Nabi Bakhsh and others v. Muhammad Aslam and 7 others, 1988 MLD 1830.\n  Advocate for respondent No.2 submitted that the matter had been dismissed earlier by the Court three times. He further submitted that no Medical Certificate was enclosed with the application under Order XLI, rule 19, C.P.C.\n  C.M.A No.3526 of 2009 was filed by one Muhammad Saqib, who claimed that he has purchased property in question from respondent No 1 and therefore he is a necessary party. With the consent of the counsel, this application was heard along with main revision application. Leaned counsel for intervener stated that in view of provision contained in Order XLIII, rule 1(t), C.P.C. revision is not competent.\n  Learned counsel for applicant while exercising his right of reply submitted that order suffered from the basic illegality because property was situated outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, which decided the matter and therefore Court was coram non judice. He submitted that revision is maintainable because section 115, C.P.C. includes the eases where Court exercises power which is not vested in it by law.\n  The application for restoration of application for rehearing of appeal was made on the same day when application for restoration of application for rehearing of appeal was dismissed i.e. on 03-2-2007. Application reads as under:---\n  It is respectfully prayed that this Honourable Court may kindly be pleased to restore the application under. Order XLI, rule 19, read with section 151, C.P.C. for re-admission/restoration of appeal as the said matter was fixed today on 3-2-2007 for service but the application under Order XLI, rule 19 is wrongly be dismiss in no appearance of appellant's Advocate as the Advocate was present early in the morning and mark his presence on cause list but the application under Order XLI, Rule 19 read with section 151, C.P.C. for re-admission/ restoration of appeal has wrongly been dismissed as that was not fixed today for hearing.\"\n  I have considered submissions made by the learned counsel and have also gone through the record as well as case-law cited by the learned counsel.\n  I will first deal with objection regarding maintainability of the revision petition. Contention of the learned counsel for the respondent as well that of the intervener is that the Order passed by a Court by which order application for restoration of application for re-hearing the appeal was dismissed is, according to the learned counsel, appealable under rule 1(t) .,: Order XLIII. Said rule reads ad under:---\n  \"(1) Appeals for orders.-- An appeal shall lie from the following orders under the provisions of section 104; namely\n  (t) an order of refusal under rule 19 of Order XLI to re-admit, or under rule 21 of Order XLI to re-hear, an appeal.\"\n  A perusal of rule indicates that it covers two situations;\n  (a) refusal under Order XLI of Rule 49, C.P.C. to re-admit an appeal; or\n  (b) refusal under rule.21 of Order XLI, C.P.C. to rehear the appeal. Rule 19 of Order XLI provides as under:---\n  \"19. Re-admission of appeal dismissed for default.-- (1) Where an appeal is dismissed under R.11, sub-rule (2), or rule 17 or rule 18, the appellant may apply to the Appellate Court for the re-admission of the appeal; and where it is proved that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when the appeal was called on for hearing or from depositing the sum so required, the Court shall re-admit the appeal on' such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit.\"\n  Rule 21 of Order XLI C.P.C. provides as under:\n  \"21. Re-hearing on application of respondent against whom ex parte decree made.-- (1) Where an appeal is heard ex parte and judgment is pronounced against the respondent, he may apply to the appellate Court to re-hear the appeal; and, if he satisfies the Court that the notice was not duly served or that he was prevented by sufficient cause from appearing when the appeal was called on for hearing, the Court shall re-hear the appeal on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit to impose upon him.\n  (2) The provisions of section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1908 (IX of 1908) shall apply to application under sub-rule (1).\"\n  Obviously rule 19 has no applicability because rule 19 is a rule which deals with application for re-admitting an appeal. Rule 21 has no applicability because very opening word of the rule say that when appeal is heard ex parte and judgment is pronounced against the respondent. In this case appeal was not heard ex parte. What has been done is that application for restoration of application for re-admitting the appeal has been dismissed. Therefore, rule 1(t) of Order XLIII, C.P.C. are not available to the present applicant and consequently this revision application is held to be maintainable.\n  I will next take up application under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. (C.M.A. No.3526 of 2009). In this C.M.A intervener has stated that he purchased property in question believing respondent No.1 and after approaching the respondent No.2 and enquiring about documents of the property. He, however, stated in this application that late he came to know about pendency of appeal/dispute regarding the subject property. Therefore, he is necessary party in the matter. Under Order I, rule 10 C.P.C. an intervener can be impleaded as a party only when either it is a necessary party or it is a proper party. Necessary party is the one, who ought to have been joined and in hose absence no effective adjudication can take place or decree passed. A proper party is the party whose presence is necessary before the Court in order to completely and effectually adjudicate upon and settle all questions involved in the suit. A subsequent purchaser who purchased the property during pendency of dispute between seller and buyer of the same property is neither necessary party nor proper party. Therefore, application under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. is dismissed. In any case the only objection raised by the intervener is regarding maintainability of the revision application which objection I have over ruled above.\n  Since I have held that revision application is maintainable I need not advert to the objection raised by the learned counsel for the application that since suit property was situated out side the territorial jurisdiction of trial Court, the order of the trial Court was coram non judice. I am afraid, I cannot agree to this objection in any case for the reasons stated in section 21 of the C.P.C., which requires that no objection as to the place of suing shall be allowed by any appellate or revisional Court unless such objection was taken in the Court at first instance at the earliest possible opportunity and not in all cases where the issues are settled, on or before such settlement and unless there has been consequent failure of justice. No such objection appears to have been taken in the written statement or even before the issues were framed. Therefore, argument is without force.\n  Coming to the crux question: that on 3-2-2007 application for restoration of application for re-admission of appeal was fixed for service and therefore whether it could not have been heard and decided.\n  Learned counsel firstly relied upon Ahmad Nawaz's case. This is on the question of territorial jurisdiction and therefore is of no assistance to the applicant. Secondly learned counsel relied upon Ghulam Fareed's case. Again this case is on the issue of territorial jurisdiction and does not help case of the applicant, Faqir Alam's case decided by Supreme Court of Azad Jammu and' Kashmir is of relevance in this regard. The relevant observation is at page 1325, which reads as under:---\n  \"In the instant case, however, the question is as to whether the dismissal of the suit on 14-5-1973 can be regarded to be one falling under Order IX, rule 8. As has been already stated, the aforesaid date was fixed for the appearance of the plaintiff and the notice to the plaintiff for the said date had also not been returned after service. Thus, the date fixed for the appearance of the party cannot be said to be a date of `hearing' within the meaning of Order IX, rule 8. The provisions of Order IX, rule 8 would be attracted only if the suit is fixed for hearing and not otherwise. If a dismissal is ordered on a date not fixed for hearing the order of dismissal of the suit would not fall under Order IX, rule 8 and, therefore, such an order would be without jurisdiction. \"\n  On the other hand learned counsel for the respondent relied upon Zahid Ahmad's case, wherein it was held that negligence on the part of the advocate has binding effect on his client and if a party engages the advocate who was lacking in sense of responsibility to the Court it was the party who should suffer and not the other side. In Zaheeruddin's case, application for restoration of appeal was dismissed because counsel failed to appear and represent his client. It was held that non-appearance was due to negligence and no sufficient cause for non-appearance had been made out and therefore appeal was dismissed. In Sindh Sugar Corporation Limited's case on 14-3-2006 application in which prayer for re-admission for the appeal was made was dismissed by High Court. Application for re-admission of appeal was filed on 26-1-2006 i.e. after more than 30 days and prayer for condonation of delay was made. The application was dismissed by the Honourable Supreme Court. In Muhammad Ashraf's case, application for re-admission of appeal was filed seventy-four days after dismissal of appeal for non-prosecution. There was no application for condonation of delay. Consequently application for restoration of appeal was dismissed. In Syed Akhtar's case application for re-admission of appeal was dismissed for non-prosecution. In Nabi Buksh's case it was held that refusal to re-admit appeal would be an appealable order under Order XLIII, C.P.C. All these cases are clearly distinguishable.\n  In the present case diary of the Court reveals that when on 19-1-2007 it was adjourned to 3-2-2007 it was adjourned for service. Therefore, all that Court could have done on 3-2-2007 was to hold whether service has taken place or not. It first adjourned the matter to 11-00 a.m. Earlier in the morning both the counsel were present. At 11-15 a.m. it was dismissed for non-prosecution and on the same day at 1-00 p.m. an application for restoration of application was filed. Therefore in my opinion order of the appellate Court suffers from an infirmity. On 8-2-2007 it could have held service good when both the counsel were present and then adjourn the matter to a date for hearing. However, if both counsel were present there was nothing to preclude Court to hear both parties with their consent and thereafter decide the matter. The circumstances did not warrant dismissal of application. Consequently order dated 2-11-2007 passed by appellate Court is set aside and the matter is remanded to the appellate Court to first decide application under Order XLI, rule 19, C.P.C. filed by the present applicant and thereafter in the light of this such decision proceed in accordance with law. Parties are left to bear their own costs.\n  MUY/Z-26/K Order accordingly.",

In the order restoring the application, the High Court observed that the matter had been fixed for order and not for hearing and on this ground application for restoration was allowed. Learned counsel relied upon Ahmed Nawaz and 4 others v. Abdul Khalique and 13 others 2002 MLD 1783 and Ghulam Fareed v. Shahid-ud-Din Toghalaq, PLD 2008 Kar. 536.\n  Learned counsel for the respondent made the following submissions:\n  (1) Since application under Order XLI, rule 19, C.P.C, had been dismissed it is appealable order under Order XLIII, rule 1(t), C.P.C. and therefore, revision is not maintainable.\n  (2) That since one application for restoration had been dismissed, no second application for restoration could be filed and the matter had become res judicate. He relied upon Faqir Alam and 10 others v. Ajab Khan and 15 others, 1986 CLC 1320.\n  (3) That there were three Advocates in whose favour Vakalatama had been executed, at least one of them should have been present.\n  (4) That fur service means for hearing and when matter was called at 11-00 a.m. no one was present for the present applicant. He relied upon Zahid Ahmad v. Deputy Director Adjudication and 2 others PLD 2006 Kar. 252, Zaheeruddin v. Hashmatullah 1986 CLC 2609, Sindh Sugar Corporation Limited v. Messrs Maqbool Associates, Karachi, 2008 SCMR 47, Muhammad Ashfaq v. Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan, 2000 CLC 1760, Syed Junaid Akhtar and others v. Managing Director/Chairman, PLD 2008 SC 130, Nabi Bakhsh and others v. Muhammad Aslam and 7 others, 1988 MLD 1830.\n  Advocate for respondent No.2 submitted that the matter had been dismissed earlier by the Court three times. He further submitted that no Medical Certificate was enclosed with the application under Order XLI, rule 19, C.P.C.\n  C.M.A No.3526 of 2009 was filed by one Muhammad Saqib, who claimed that he has purchased property in question from respondent No 1 and therefore he is a necessary party. With the consent of the counsel, this application was heard along with main revision application. Leaned counsel for intervener stated that in view of provision contained in Order XLIII, rule 1(t), C.P.C. revision is not competent.\n  Learned counsel for applicant while exercising his right of reply submitted that order suffered from the basic illegality because property was situated outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, which decided the matter and therefore Court was coram non judice. He submitted that revision is maintainable because section 115, C.P.C. includes the eases where Court exercises power which is not vested in it by law.\n  The application for restoration of application for rehearing of appeal was made on the same day when application for restoration of application for rehearing of appeal was dismissed i.e. on 03-2-2007. Application reads as under:---\n  It is respectfully prayed that this Honourable Court may kindly be pleased to restore the application under. Order XLI, rule 19, read with section 151, C.P.C. for re-admission/restoration of appeal as the said matter was fixed today on 3-2-2007 for service but the application under Order XLI, rule 19 is wrongly be dismiss in no appearance of appellant's Advocate as the Advocate was present early in the morning and mark his presence on cause list but the application under Order XLI, Rule 19 read with section 151, C.P.C. for re-admission/ restoration of appeal has wrongly been dismissed as that was not fixed today for hearing.\"\n  I have considered submissions made by the learned counsel and have also gone through the record as well as case-law cited by the learned counsel.\n  I will first deal with objection regarding maintainability of the revision petition. Contention of the learned counsel for the respondent as well that of the intervener is that the Order passed by a Court by which order application for restoration of application for re-hearing the appeal was dismissed is, according to the learned counsel, appealable under rule 1(t) .,: Order XLIII. Said rule reads ad under:---\n  \"(1) Appeals for orders.-- An appeal shall lie from the following orders under the provisions of section 104; namely\n  (t) an order of refusal under rule 19 of Order XLI to re-admit, or under rule 21 of Order XLI to re-hear, an appeal.\"\n  A perusal of rule indicates that it covers two situations;\n  (a) refusal under Order XLI of Rule 49, C.P.C. to re-admit an appeal; or\n  (b) refusal under rule.21 of Order XLI, C.P.C. to rehear the appeal. Rule 19 of Order XLI provides as under:---\n  \"19. Re-admission of appeal dismissed for default.-- (1) Where an appeal is dismissed under R.11, sub-rule (2), or rule 17 or rule 18, the appellant may apply to the Appellate Court for the re-admission of the appeal; and where it is proved that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when the appeal was called on for hearing or from depositing the sum so required, the Court shall re-admit the appeal on' such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit.\"\n  Rule 21 of Order XLI C.P.C. provides as under:\n  \"21. Re-hearing on application of respondent against whom ex parte decree made.-- (1) Where an appeal is heard ex parte and judgment is pronounced against the respondent, he may apply to the appellate Court to re-hear the appeal; and, if he satisfies the Court that the notice was not duly served or that he was prevented by sufficient cause from appearing when the appeal was called on for hearing, the Court shall re-hear the appeal on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit to impose upon him.\n  (2) The provisions of section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1908 (IX of 1908) shall apply to application under sub-rule (1).\"\n  Obviously rule 19 has no applicability because rule 19 is a rule which deals with application for re-admitting an appeal. Rule 21 has no applicability because very opening word of the rule say that when appeal is heard ex parte and judgment is pronounced against the respondent. In this case appeal was not heard ex parte. What has been done is that application for restoration of application for re-admitting the appeal has been dismissed. Therefore, rule 1(t) of Order XLIII, C.P.C. are not available to the present applicant and consequently this revision application is held to be maintainable.\n  I will next take up application under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. (C.M.A. No.3526 of 2009). In this C.M.A intervener has stated that he purchased property in question believing respondent No.1 and after approaching the respondent No.2 and enquiring about documents of the property. He, however, stated in this application that late he came to know about pendency of appeal/dispute regarding the subject property. Therefore, he is necessary party in the matter. Under Order I, rule 10 C.P.C. an intervener can be impleaded as a party only when either it is a necessary party or it is a proper party. Necessary party is the one, who ought to have been joined and in hose absence no effective adjudication can take place or decree passed. A proper party is the party whose presence is necessary before the Court in order to completely and effectually adjudicate upon and settle all questions involved in the suit. A subsequent purchaser who purchased the property during pendency of dispute between seller and buyer of the same property is neither necessary party nor proper party. Therefore, application under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. is dismissed. In any case the only objection raised by the intervener is regarding maintainability of the revision application which objection I have over ruled above.\n  Since I have held that revision application is maintainable I need not advert to the objection raised by the learned counsel for the application that since suit property was situated out side the territorial jurisdiction of trial Court, the order of the trial Court was coram non judice. I am afraid, I cannot agree to this objection in any case for the reasons stated in section 21 of the C.P.C., which requires that no objection as to the place of suing shall be allowed by any appellate or revisional Court unless such objection was taken in the Court at first instance at the earliest possible opportunity and not in all cases where the issues are settled, on or before such settlement and unless there has been consequent failure of justice. No such objection appears to have been taken in the written statement or even before the issues were framed. Therefore, argument is without force.\n  Coming to the crux question: that on 3-2-2007 application for restoration of application for re-admission of appeal was fixed for service and therefore whether it could not have been heard and decided.\n  Learned counsel firstly relied upon Ahmad Nawaz's case. This is on the question of territorial jurisdiction and therefore is of no assistance to the applicant. Secondly learned counsel relied upon Ghulam Fareed's case. Again this case is on the issue of territorial jurisdiction and does not help case of the applicant, Faqir Alam's case decided by Supreme Court of Azad Jammu and' Kashmir is of relevance in this regard. The relevant observation is at page 1325, which reads as under:---\n  \"In the instant case, however, the question is as to whether the dismissal of the suit on 14-5-1973 can be regarded to be one falling under Order IX, rule 8. As has been already stated, the aforesaid date was fixed for the appearance of the plaintiff and the notice to the plaintiff for the said date had also not been returned after service. Thus, the date fixed for the appearance of the party cannot be said to be a date of `hearing' within the meaning of Order IX, rule 8. The provisions of Order IX, rule 8 would be attracted only if the suit is fixed for hearing and not otherwise. If a dismissal is ordered on a date not fixed for hearing the order of dismissal of the suit would not fall under Order IX, rule 8 and, therefore, such an order would be without jurisdiction. \"\n  On the other hand learned counsel for the respondent relied upon Zahid Ahmad's case, wherein it was held that negligence on the part of the advocate has binding effect on his client and if a party engages the advocate who was lacking in sense of responsibility to the Court it was the party who should suffer and not the other side. In Zaheeruddin's case, application for restoration of appeal was dismissed because counsel failed to appear and represent his client. It was held that non-appearance was due to negligence and no sufficient cause for non-appearance had been made out and therefore appeal was dismissed. In Sindh Sugar Corporation Limited's case on 14-3-2006 application in which prayer for re-admission for the appeal was made was dismissed by High Court. Application for re-admission of appeal was filed on 26-1-2006 i.e. after more than 30 days and prayer for condonation of delay was made. The application was dismissed by the Honourable Supreme Court. In Muhammad Ashraf's case, application for re-admission of appeal was filed seventy-four days after dismissal of appeal for non-prosecution. There was no application for condonation of delay. Consequently application for restoration of appeal was dismissed. In Syed Akhtar's case application for re-admission of appeal was dismissed for non-prosecution. In Nabi Buksh's case it was held that refusal to re-admit appeal would be an appealable order under Order XLIII, C.P.C. All these cases are clearly distinguishable.\n",

Learned trial Court was pleased to grant the requisite decree in favour of petitioner on 30-4-2004, however, it was reversed by learned Court of appeal on 3-5-2005. Consequently, the suit of petitioner stood dismissed. Aggrieved from the findings of the learned appellate Court the petitioner has preferred the instant revision petition under section 115 of Civil Procedure Code, 1908.\n  2. The facts emanating from the record suggest that the defendants-respondents transacted the sale of suit property on 16-6-1998, of which the knowledge was acquired by plaintiff, purportedly, on 13-6-2000. Subsequently, the suit was filed on 4-7-2000. It was the claim of petitioner-plaintiff that the suit property was contiguous to his residential house, and was sold away by the sons of one Jalandar in favour of defendants/respondents for a consideration of Rs.100,000 (Rupees one lac only), however, no notice for the sale was ever given to the petitioner. That, on coming to know regarding the factum of sale, the petitioner-plaintiff performed Talb-i-Muwathibat on 13-6-2000 being present at his house and in the company of Zahoor Khan son of Gujar Khan as well as Bakht Zaman the son of the former. The other requisite Talbs were also performed by him in due course of time.\n  3. Learned Court of appeal, while dislodging the claim of petitioner-plaintiff and non-suiting him, had inter alia held that Talb i-Ishhad was performed by him through his son Bakht Zaman who was constituted as a general attorney in the year 1988. The said Agent/attorney was not conferred with the powers to create Talbs in accordance with the provisions contained in N.-W.F.P. Pre-emption Act, 1987, therefore, the plaintiff remained at loss in carrying out his obligation as required by the special statute. It was further observed that despite the claim of petitioner qua having personally performed Talb-i-Muwathibat, he held himself back from appearing before the learned trial Court and making a statement to the said effect. The suit of petitioner was, therefore, dismissed on acceptance of appeal.\n  5.(sic) I have heard learned counsel for petitioner who argued in terms that the findings of learned Court of appeal were not recorded in compliance with Order-XLI, rule 31 of C.P.C. as it failed to attend the entire points of controversy between the parties. The said judgment was therefore, liable for setting aside. In this regard he referred to PLD 1993 Peshawar 131. Learned counsel next contended that in view of valuation contained in the suit the petitioner was obligated to have deposited court-fee along with memorandum of his appeal but he squarely failed to do so. No relief in the appeal was, therefore, allowable in favour of the petitioner. He was also of the view that in the light of provisions contained in Contract Act, 1872, the attorney of petitioner could be considered to have been impliedly authorized for performance of requisite acts under the N.-W.F.P. Pre-emption Act, 1987. He referred to 2004 MLD 650, 2004 CLC 359 in the said context.\n  6. On the other hand learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondents referred to PLJ 2003 Peshawar 324, 1995 CLC 1541-1572, 1996 CLC 161, PLD 1969 Kar. 123, 2007 SCMR 1956, 2005 CLC 325 and contended that the instrument of Power of Attorney, executed by the petitioner, did not specifically provide for the requisite powers in favour of Agent. Beside, the said instrument also died not authorize the Agent to institute a pre-emption suit which essentially was founded on the personal rights of petitioner. He further referred to dates of execution of impugned sale deed and that of filing of suit by petitioner in order to substantiate his arguments regarding the latter having been brought after expiry of period prescribed for the purpose. He was also of the argument that by not producing the original notice of Talib-e-Ishhad or a copy therefore, through secondary evidence, the same could not be proved.\n  7. I have carefully perused the available record and have also considered the arguments by learned counsel for the parties. It emerges that the contention of petitioner before this Court is devoid of any substance firstly, for the reason that he was compulsorily non-suited by learned Court of appeal mainly on the ground that he remained unsuccessful in performing the requisite Talbs in accordance with law. Having taken such view of the matter it was, therefore, not obligatory upon the learned Court to have expressed it opinion qua the other limbs of controversy between the parties. It is added that Talb-i-Muwathibat as well as Talb-i-Ishhad provide foundation for a suit for pre-emption/Talb-i-Khusumat to a pre-emptor and in case the former are found not to have been performed in accordance with law or not having been performed at all, the entire edifice raised thereupon is bound to collapse. The findings of learned Court of appeal to the said extent, therefore, are not exposed to exceptions.\n  8. The second limb of submissions regarding non-affixation of court-fee to the memorandum of appeal by the respondent also does not merit a favourable &'vision. In the said context it shall be beneficial to refer to the findings of learned trial Court on issue No.5, which determined the dispute regarding non-affixation of court-fee by the petitioner along with the plaint. The issue decided in negative, which was originally struck due to a preliminary objection by the respondent through his written statement. As this stage it, therefore, does not lie in the mouth of petitioner to raise the said objection qua appeal of respondent.\n  9. The contents of General Power of Attorney (Exh.P.W.1/1), which was executed by the petitioner in favour of his son, reveal that it was completed on 25-5-1988 and was registered on 25-5-1988 at the office of Sub-Registrar Dargai, wherein, Bakhti Zaman was appointed and constituted as Agent of the petitioner with the investment of powers to appear on his behalf in multiple case and proceedings already pending or to be instituted against the petitioner, or on his behalf. The said contents did not, at all, authorize the attorney to perform the requisite Talbs in connection with exercise of right of pre-emption by the petitioner nor to file a suit for the purpose. It shall be important to note here that the performance of Talh-i-Muwathibat and Talb-i-Ishhad was apersonal obligation of the petitioner while he could have done so through an Agent under the provisions of section-14 of the Act ibid, albeit after properly and specifically constituting the latter in the said respect. In the case in hand, there was no such authorization in favour of Attorney appointed through Exh. P. W.1/1.\n  10. There is yet another aspect of the dispute between the parties before this Court which relates to the defect in performance of Talb-i-Muwathibat by the petitioner. A perusal of para.5 of the plaint together with the statement of P.W.1, the attorney of petitioner-plaintiff, would unequivocally disclose that at the relevant time of gaining of knowledge of suit transaction the petitioner only declared his superior right of pre-emption to the suit property when he was present in his house. Declaration by the petitioner was, therefore, not in accordance with provisions contained in section 11 of the Act ibid, wherein, explanation (1) describes Talb-i-Muwathibat as immediate demand by a pre-emptor in the sitting or meeting (Majlis) in which he has come to know of the sale, declaring his intention to exercise the right of pre-emption. Admittedly, no such declaration appears to have been made by the petitioner.\n  12. In. view of the above, the petition in hand remains meritless in order to attract the superintending jurisdiction of this Court for interference in the resultant findings of learned Court of appeal. It is, therefore, hereby dismissed while the parties are left to bear their respective cost.\n  H.B.T. /213/P Petition dismissed.",

In the case in hand, there was no such authorization in favour of Attorney appointed through Exh. P. W.1/1.\n  10. There is yet another aspect of the dispute between the parties before this Court which relates to the defect in performance of Talb-i-Muwathibat by the petitioner. A perusal of para.5 of the plaint together with the statement of P.W.1, the attorney of petitioner-plaintiff, would unequivocally disclose that at the relevant time of gaining of knowledge of suit transaction the petitioner only declared his superior right of pre-emption to the suit property when he was present in his house. Declaration by the petitioner was, therefore, not in accordance with provisions contained in section 11 of the Act ibid, wherein, explanation (1) describes Talb-i-Muwathibat as immediate demand by a pre-emptor in the sitting or meeting (Majlis) in which he has come to know of the sale, declaring his intention to exercise the right of pre-emption. Admittedly, no such declaration appears to have been made by the petitioner.",

The petitioner claims to be a joint owner in land measuring 30 Kanals 8 Marlas comprised in Khewat No.1, Khatuni No. 124 comprised in Khasra numbers mentioned in detail in the first paragraph of the-petition situation at Niampur, Tehsil and District Gujranwala. The dispute relates to a portion measuring 3 Kanals, 18 Marlas comprised in Khasra No.702/399. The petitioner admits that the respondents have been in exclusive possession of the said land for a long time. The petitioner filed a suit for possession through partition seeking various reliefs including an order that the respondents be restrained from constructing a CNG Station on the suit property, which appears to be the main reason for filing the suit. An application for temporary injunction was also filed with the plaint.\n  3. The respondents filed their written statement as well as reply to the application for interim injunction. The defence taken by the respondent was that the entire Khata consisted of a much larger land area consisting of 394 Kanals, 16 Marlas out of which the petitioner and respondents Nos.5 and 7 to 11 had already sold 247 Kanals and 15 Marlas with a front of three acres facing the main road in favour of Mojeeb-ur-Rehman son of Sardar Muhammad Ansari. Mojeebur Rehman had established a housing colony under the name and style of Mojeeb Colony on the said land and had sold plots to a large number of buyers. Therefore, the claim of the petitioner to be co-owner in the remaining Khata to the extent of one Kanal out of the total of 30 Kanals, 8 Marlas was open to question. It was further averred that as a result of a family partition the respondents were in possession of land measuring 3 Kanals 18 Marlas comprised in Khata No.702/399 for the last 25 years and that the petitioner had no nexus or connection with the said portion. The possession of the respondents was an admitted fact and the only claim of the petitioner was that being a co - owner in the Khata, he was entitled to and had a proprietary interest in every inch of the undivided Khata.\n  4. It appears from the record that the respondents initiated construction of the CNG Station on the land in their possession in Khasra No.702.399 in accordance with a site plan which was duly approved by the competent authorities. A license was obtained by the respondents from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority on 15-3-2006, the installation of CNG Station. Permission to start construction was given by the competent authority on 8-7-2007: The requisite plant, machinery and equipment was imported in October, 2008. Electricity, gas and other related utilities were simultaneously installed in the later part of the year 2008. According to the respondents, they borrowed a sum of Rs.9.8 million from Bank Alfalah Limited for the aforesaid project. In order to secure the said loan the land in question was mortgaged in favour of Bank Alfalah Limited.\n  5. The suit in question was filed on 11-2-2009 when the CNG Station was on the verge of going into commercial operation. The learned Civil Judge after hearing the parties and examining the record declined to issue a restraining order against the respondents. An appeal filed by the petitioner before the learned Additional District Judge, Gujranwala, did not succeed either.\n  6. It appear from the record that the petitioner approached other avenues to seek injunctive relief. He filed a suit against the Government of Pakistan, Secretary Industries, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, Inspector Explosives and the respondents seeking a restraining order against issuance of NOC for establishment of a CNG Station on the suit land. The petitioner did not succeed in those proceedings. An appeal filed by the petitioner against an order refusing to grant temporary injunction in the said suit was also dismissed by an Additional District Judge at Gujranwala, vide order dated 25-5-2009.\n  7. The learned counsel for the petitioner assails the impugned orders on the sole ground that being a co-sharer he could not be deprived of use of his share in the suit property. He submits that refusal on the part of the lower Court to grant injunctive relief amounts to depriving the petitioner forever of the right claimed in the suit land. The learned counsel relies on Muhammad Muzaffar Khan v. Muhammad Yusuf Khan PLD 1959 SC (Pak) 9 to argue that a co-sharer in an undivided Khata is entitled to a share in every portion thereof and can, therefore, restrain other co-sharers from undertaking any activity which may have the effect of changing the nature of the suit property.\n  8. I have carefully gone through the aforesaid judgment of the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan. The facts of the case and the law laid down in the said Judgment are different from what the learned counsel for the petitioner is canvassing. The Judgment lays down the law that the vendee of a co-sharer who owns a share in an undivided Khata in common with another, is clothed with the same rights as the vendor has in the property, no more and no less. If the vendor was in exclusive possession of a certain portion of the joint land and transfers its possession to his vendee, so long as there is no partition between co- ' sharers, the vendee must be regarded as stepping into the shoes of his transferor qua his ownership rights in the joint property to the extent of the area purchased by him; provided that the area in question does not exceed the share which the transferor owns in the whole property. Alienation of such plots transferred to the vendee would only entitle the later to retain possession of them till such time as an actual partition by metes and bounds takes place between the co-sharers.\n  9. The facts and circumstances of the case before this Court are different. In the first place the respondents are and have been in exclusive possession of the disputed Khasra and the land comprised there under for a considerable period of time. This fact is not disputed by the petitioner. The respondents also plead a family partition as the basis of their exclusive possession. The petitioner also does not dispute that construction work on the CNG Station started in 2005 when various activities leading to setting up of the CNG Station were being undertaken. These include construction of building, obtaining gas and electricity connections, import and installation of machinery, obtaining necessary approvals, permissions and license from various State, Provincial and Local Government functionaries etc. All these activities could not have gone unnoticed by the petitioner. He kept quiet and let the respondents undertake all the said activities without any objection or protest of any nature. He immediately sprang into action and filed a suit for possession through a partition suit on 11-2-2009, as soon as all the construction and installation activity was completed and the project was about to be commercially launched. The relief sought inter alia included a decree; of permanent injunction against setting up of a CNG Station on the suit land. Having failed to get the requisite results in the said suit, the petitioner filed another suit on 28-3-2009, impleading various functionaries including OGRA, Inspector Explosives etc., a brief reference to which has already been made in the preceding paragraph.\n  10. The objective of this entire exercise appears to be to restrain the respondents from putting the CNG Station into service and thus to put them under pressure knowing that the project has been setup against a Bank loan which will have to be repaid from the proceeds of the business undertaken through the CNG Station.\n  11. The conduct of the petitioner points towards mala fides. There is enough material on record on the basis of which it can be concluded that he has not come to the Court with clean hands. If the petitioner was serious and bona fide wanted to assert his claim, he had ample time and opportunity since 2005 when the first visible steps were taken towards establishment of the CNG Station, to approach a Court of competent jurisdiction and assert his claim. The fact that he sat back for about four years and let the respondents undertake construction, invest money and install a CNG Station is sufficient to attract the principle of estoppel and acquiescence against the petitioner. In the opinion of this Court the petitioner is estopped for changing his position at this stage in a manner that may be detrimental to the interest of the respondents having acquiesced in the action of the respondents for more than four years.\n  12. It is interesting to note that in the appeal filed before the learned Additional District Judge the prayer made by the petitioner was changed from seeking a restraining order against the \"construction of a CNG Station\"' to restraining order against the respondents from \"operating a CNG Station Surely between 30-4-2009 when the stay application was dismissed and 4-5-2009 when the appeal was filed a CNG Station was not constructed over night on the disputed land.\n  13. It is settled law that a co-sharer in possession in a Khata has a right to alienate a specific piece of land in his possession and the transferee acquires the same rights as the transferor. This principle has also been reiterated in the judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan, cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner. Further, no bar has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioner against a co-sharer in possession of a Khata from utilizing the land in his possession for any lawful purpose. It would be absurd to suggest that by reason of construction of a CNG Station the petitioner's rights (which are yet to be determined) would be adversely affected or value of his share will be diminished, in the event that partition of Khata takes place and a portion of the land in question falls in his shares. This is notwithstanding the claim of the respondents that the Khata has already been partitioned by way of a family partition pursuant to which they are holding possession for the past many years. The learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to convince me as to how the value of the property would be reduced by reason of installation of a CNG Station on it.\n  14. The learned counsel for the respondent has taken the position that a co-sharer cannot seek an injunction against another co-sharer where both are in exclusive and continuous possession of their respective shares. The learned counsel relies on Shah Hussain v. Abdul Qayyum and others 1984 SCMR 427; Muhammad Sharif and 3 others v. Ghulam Hussain and other 1995 SCMR 514 and a Judgment of this Court passed in Aman Ullah v. Hameed Ullah and others 2006 YLR 856 in support of this proposition. The injunction being sought by the petitioner falls in the category of injunctions discussed in the afore-cited Judgments which are on all fours with the instant case.\n  15. In order to be entitled to injunctive relief which in any event is equitable and discretionary in nature, the three ingredients for grant of injunctions, namely, prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss have to be established. It has been held that all the three ingredients have to be present at the same time. In case any one of the ingredients is missing, the Court cannot grant temporary injunction.\n  16. From a perusal of the record it is clear that the suit is at the preliminary stage. The right of the petitioner in the suit land and its extent is yet to be determined by recording of evidence. So is the claim of the respondents that they are in exclusive possession of the same for the past 25 years on the basis of a family partition. Therefore, a prima facie case in favour of the petitioner is clearly not made out. Admittedly respondents have invested huge sums of money on construction of the CNG Station and installation of equipment and machinery thereon. An order restraining them from operating the CNG Station will inconvenience them more compared to the petitioner who has had no nexus or connection with the suit land for the past 25 years. Even if for the sake of argument it is admitted that there is a possibility that the petitioner will be found entitled to a share in the disputed property if and when it is ultimately partitioned, the loss, if any, would be calculable in monetary terms. Therefore, the ingredient of irreparable loss is also missing in this case.\n  17. The learned subordinate Courts have kept all the aforesaid factors in mind, applied the correct principles of law and reached an unexceptionable conclusion. The learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to point out or identify any piece of evidence that was available on record and has either been misread or ignored by the learned lower Courts. Further, the learned counsel has not been able to show any illegality or material irregularity committed by the learned subordinate Courts in exercise of the jurisdiction vested in them.\n  18. In view of the above, I do not find any merit in this petition. It is, accordingly dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.\n  M.U.Y./A-315/L Petition dismissed.",

The injunction being sought by the petitioner falls in the category of injunctions discussed in the afore-cited Judgments which are on all fours with the instant case.\r\n  15. In order to be entitled to injunctive relief which in any event is equitable and discretionary in nature, the three ingredients for grant of injunctions, namely, prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss have to be established. It has been held that all the three ingredients have to be present at the same time. In case any one of the ingredients is missing, the Court cannot grant temporary injunction.\r\n  16. From a perusal of the record it is clear that the suit is at the preliminary stage. The right of the petitioner in the suit land and its extent is yet to be determined by recording of evidence. So is the claim of the respondents that they are in exclusive possession of the same for the past 25 years on the basis of a family partition. Therefore, a prima facie case in favour of the petitioner is clearly not made out. Admittedly respondents have invested huge sums of money on construction of the CNG Station and installation of equipment and machinery thereon. An order restraining them from operating the CNG Station will inconvenience them more compared to the petitioner who has had no nexus or connection with the suit land for the past 25 years. Even if for the sake of argument it is admitted that there is a possibility that the petitioner will be found entitled to a share in the disputed property if and when it is ultimately partitioned, the loss, if any, would be calculable in monetary terms. Therefore, the ingredient of irreparable loss is also missing in this case.",

Suit was filed in January 1984. It was pleaded in the plaint that the plaintiff was allowed by the defendant/present Respondent No.1 to occupy residential Plot bearing No.S-1/76, in Saudabad, Malir, Karachi in 1975. It was further claimed in the plaint that suit plot was transferred in favour of the plaintiff by he Welfare Officer of the Trust the respondent No.1. When the Trust failed to execute lease-deed in favour of the plaintiff although it had executed lease-deed in favour of one Gul Shahzad for another plot, the suit was filed with prayer that defendant be directed to execute a lease-deed for Plot No. S-1 /766, Saudabad, Karachi in favour of the plaintiff.\n  2. Written-statement was filed by the present respondent No.1. It was denied in the 2. written-statement that plaintiff was allotted the said plot. The plaintiff was stated to be an un-authorized occupant of the said plot and was alleged to have raised construction thereon illegally. It was specifically denied that the plot was transferred to the plaintiff as it had already been given to Jamat-e-Islamia Farooqui Masjid in 1969.\n  3. Two parties led their evidence and thereafter the trial Court vide order dated 4-2-2000 decreed the suit. An appeal was filed by the present plaintiff and the Appellate Court vide order dated 12-3-2002 allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit. Being aggrieved by the order of the Appellate Court passed on 12-3-2002 this revision application was filed.\n  4. Learned counsel for the applicants extensively read from pages 93 to 101 (pages 11 to 15) of the order of the trial Court. He submitted that demand note dated 24-8-1971 was issued to him by the Additional Deputy Commissioner and he made payment of Rs.600 in accordance with the demand note. He further submitted that adjacent plot has been leased to one Gul Shahzad. However, when he approached respondent No.1 with request for lease of plot to him it was .declined. He referred to cross-examination of the Welfare Officer of the respondent No.1, where the Welfare Officer had admitted occupation by the plaintiff and also admitted that construction of Masjid has been completed. However, Welfare Officer stated that the said plot has not been allotted to any one so far. Welfare Officer also stated that plan for Masjid was approved in 1969 and plot in question was allotted to the Masjid on 5-1-1984. The learned counsel referred to the allotment order dated 5-1-1984 and submitted that there is no mention of his plot in this allotment order. He further submitted that no one from the Office of Deputy Commissioner appeared as witness.\n  5. Learned counsel for the respondent after referring to his written-statement pointed out that the plaintiff in his plaint had stated that he was allowed to occupy plot in 1975 by Welfare Officer. He submitted that the Welfare Officer has no authority to allot any plot to any one: it could only be done by the Board of Trustees. Learned counsel referred to the alleged letter of the Additional Deputy Commissioner and pointed out that firstly this letter contained typed date of 24-8-1971 and even the signatures bear the same date but thereafter date has been changed to 4-11-1972. He further submitted that this letter has never been brought in evidence. He further submitted that it was an amenity plot and could not have been utilized for the purpose of private resident. Regarding manipulation of the date, the learned counsel. pointed out that even annexure \"E\" is dated 12-12-1970 and plaintiff in his plaint has stated that he was put in occupation in 1975. No such order allowing him occupation has been produced in evidence.\n  6. I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel and have also gone through the record.\n  7. Appellate Court framed the following issues:-\n  \"(1) Whether the suit of the plaintiff was not maintainable in law?\n  (2) Whether the plaintiff/respondent was allotted property in question legally and lawfully?\n  (3) Whether the Lower Court has committed any illegality or irregularity?\n  (4) What should the order be?\"\n  8. On the first issue, the Appellate Court noted that the question to be determined is, because that was the main dispute between the parties, whether the plot in question was allotted to the plaintiff or not and if such allotment had taken place whether it was lawful and legal. The Appellate Court noted that Saudabad Trust was created on the basis of funds of Saudi officials and donors for religious purposes. It was the Board of Trustees and the Deputy Commissioner who were authorized to allot the plot and no other person was authorized and allotment made by any other cannot be treated as legal and valid until and unless the Board of Trustees had approved it and subsequently notified it. Welfare Officer give cover to a person who had been illegally put in possession. Since the plaintiff had pleaded that it was Welfare Officer who had allowed him the piece of land, such allotment, if at all, of such piece of land was non est. By-laws of the Trust contain no such authority for the Welfare Officer. Since the learned counsel for the applicants placed a lot of emphasis on the letter alleged to have been issued by the Additional Deputy Commissioner on 24-8-1971 Or 4-11-1972. It may refer to it. This letter is a cyclostyled document. Even the signatures are cyclostyled. This letter was not produced in evidence. Even during appeal no efforts had been made to prove existence of this letter. Therefore, this Court just cannot act and decide on the basis of such a document which have no legs to stand upon.\n  9. Once a trespasser always a trespasser. The plaintiff has stated in his plaint that he was put in occupation and his claim is that he was allotted this plot by the Welfare Officer; unfortunately he has not been able to produce hat Welfare Officer in he dock. Bye-Laws of the Trust contain in Para-4 provision in this regard. Relevant bye-law in para.4(a) is as under;--\n  \"4. Administrator.---The Board may appoint an Administrator or Hony. Secretary for the supervision and administration of the Trust property on such terms and conditions and on such remuneration as the Board may decide from time to time.\n  (c) He shall have the powers to make allotment of land and quarters subject to the approval of the Trust.\"\n  10. Above makes it very clear that; (i) the plaintiff has been in illegal occupation of the plot in question; (ii) that no authorized person or the Trust had put the plaintiff in possession or had allotted the plot to him; (iii) the plaintiff is therefore a mere trespasser always liable to, eviction.\n  11. Consequently this Revision Application fails and is dismissed.\n  M.H./M-208/K Application dismissed.",

It was in compliance of the said directions when on 30-10-2004 examination-in-chief of P.W. was recorded and case was adjourned for cross-examination of the said P.W. due to the request of the counsel for respondent No.2 and non-availability of certain record. The case thereafter was adjourned a number of times and on 12-1-2005 when the plaintiffs-petitioners sought adjournment, a warning under Order XVII, rule 3, C.P.C. was issued to the said plaintiff and case adjourned to 17-1-2005, on which date as per order sheet, the defendant-respondent absented and accordingly proceeded against ex parte.\n  3. Without caring for the non-availability of any evidence on the file and the suit pertaining to recovery of huge amount of over Rupees 37 million, the learned trial Court straightaway fixed the case for ex parte arguments and order on 28-10-2005, on which date she passed ex parte decree in favour of plaintiff-petitioner and against the defendants-respondents, which is reproduced herein:---\n  \"Counsel for the plaintiff present, Representative of the plaintiff present. Suit for recovery of Rs.37,179,137 instituted. Defendants were summoned. Defendant No.2 appeared before the Court contested the suit by submitting written statements while defendant No.1 placed ex parte. During the proceeding defendant No.2 may absent and placed ex parte on 17-1-2005. Plaintiff proved his case through his evidence ex parte arguments heard. There is nothing in rebuttal so ex parte decree is hereby granted. No order as to costs.\n  File be consigned to record room after its necessary completion.\n  (Sd.) Shabana Mahsood)\nCivil Judge, Peshawar.\"\n  4. It was on 5-12-2005 that defendant-respondent No.2 moved an application for setting aside the ex parse decree and order dated 28-1-2005, which was contested by plaintiff-petitioner through reply dated 19-1-2006, whereafter the learned trial Court through the impugned order dated 15-5-2007 accepted the application dated 5-12-2005 through the following concluding para of her order:---\n  \"On 28-1-2005 ex parte decree was passed. An execution of decree was filed on 19-10-2006 whereas setting aside ex parte decree application was filed on 5-12-2005. No doubt applicant IA has delayed in filing of setting aside ex parte decree but there are plethora of judgments of superior Courts that full opportunities should be given to parties and technicalities should be avoided for the ends of justice. Moreover, the conduct of applicant from the file clearly reflects that applicant was vigilantly pursuing the case and as such cannot be punished for one absence and retard his rights. Hence, application is accepted with cost of Rs.2,000. File to come up for evidence of plaintiff on 19-6-2007.\n  (Sd.) Sumbal Naseer)\nCJ/JF C-VIII, Peshawar.\"\n  5. The plaintiff-petitioner being aggrieved of the setting aside of the ex parte decree has questioned the same through this revision petition.\n  6. Mr. Zahid Yousaf, learned A.A.-G. argued that the application for setting aside ex parte decree dated 28-1-2005 was filed on 5-12-2005 and was thus beyond the prescribed period of limitation under Article 164 of the Limitation Act. It was further contended that defendants-respondents had purposely absented from the proceedings in the suit and thus entitled to no leniency. To support his contention, he placed reliance on law laid down by Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan and reported as 2005 SCMR 609, and 2006 SCMR 631 and contended that in the absence of application under section 5 Limitation Act, the defendant respondent was not entitled to the acceptance of the application.\n  7. As against that Mr. Mushtaq Khan, Advocate, representing defendant-respondent No.2 argued that the trial Court had passed a well reasoned order, which was in the interest of safe administration of justice because earlier the said Court had without recording any evidence and/or referring to a single document passed a decree of huge amount of over 37 million rupees in favour of the plaintiff-petitioner and against the defendants-respondents which decree was not at all maintainable and thus the trial Court has rightly allowed the application and set aside the ex parte decree. No doubt, the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Honda Atlas Cars (Pakistan) Ltd. v. Honda Sarhad (Pvt.) Ltd., and other 2005 SCMR 609 and Shahid Pervez alias Shahid Hamid, v. Muhammad Ahmad Amin 2006 SCMR 63, settled the law that an application for setting aside an ex parte decree has to be filed within thirty days as provided under Article 164 of the Limitation Act and not under Article 181 as had been earlier held in the case of Messrs Rehman Weaving Factory (Regd.) v. Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan PLD 1981 SC 21, which article of the Limitation Act provides three years period of limitation.\n  8. The application of the defendant-respondent No.2 being not supported by any application under section 5, Limitation Act did not deserve to have been given a favourable consideration but in the cases aforestated where the Honourable Supreme Court settled the law, ex parte evidence had been recorded by the Courts seized of the suits and thereafter on appraised thereof passed ex parse decrees against the defendant.\n  9. The instant is a case where in spite of complicated questions of facts being involved and in the absence of evidence, the trial Court being ignorant of the settled law on the subject proceeded to pass an ex parte decree against the defendants-respondents and in favour of the plaintiffs-petitioners, which ex parte judgment has been reproduced in the earlier part of this judgment. The same can hardly be termed to be a legal verdict. The Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Kamran Co. and others v. Messrs Modern Motors and another PLD 1990 SC 713, held that in the absence of evidence a decree could not be passed and that it was incumbent upon the trial Court, particularly when the defendants in the written statement categorically denies the liability and when issues had been framed by the trial Court, to record evidence and then decide the case on merits. The same view was reiterated by the said Honourable Court in the judgment reported as Provincial Government through Collector Kohat and another v. Shabir Hussain PLD' 2005 SC 337, where k was held as under:---\n  (a) Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908)---\n  ----O. IX. Rr.11 & 13---Ex parte decree after filing of written statement by defendant, but in absence of any evidence led by plaintiff---Not justified---Such decree was set aside and suit was remanded to Trial Court for its decision on merits and in accordance with law.\n  Kamran Co. and others, v. Messrs Modern Motors and another PLD 1990 SC 713 fol.\n  (b) Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908)---\n  ----O. IX R.11---Suit involving matter relating to public interest and public property---Ex parte decree, passing of---Duty of Court not to shut its eyes to legal and factual aspects involved in suit, but to protect public interest and public property being its final custodian---Principles highlighted.\n  The Courts of law must always keep in mind that even where the law permitted passing of an ex parte decree, the Judicial Officers should not adopt the said course of action with their yes completely shut to the factual and legal aspects involved in the matter e.g. if a suit is filed seeking a decree to export heroin from Pakistan and supposing none comes forward, for whatever reasons, to defend the said suit, then could it be legal or permissible for a Court to pass a decree granting a relief which was absolutely illegal and unlawful? Likewise, Judicial Officers are required to exercise caution when they are dealing with matters relating to public property and public interest of which the Courts of law are the final custodians. Courts have never leaned in favour of giving of preferential treatment to the Government Departments or agencies but Courts are equally obliged, while granting relief, to ensure that public interest is not permitted to be jeopardized and public property is not allowed to be squandered through more collusion of some representative of a Government agency. (The underlining is mine). \"\n  10. The instant was a case where while passing the ex parte judgment and decree on 28-1-2005, the learned trial Court had totally shut its eyes and probably had not even looked to the contents of the plaint otherwise decree for such a huge amount would not have been passed in the presence of a very bulky record and that too without any proof. As evidence had yet to be recorded.\n  11. The trial court has in its order impugned herein also taken_ notice of the fact that in view of the law settled by the superior Courts to give full opportunities to the parties and avoid technicalities for doing complete justice and also that the conduct of the defendant-respondent No.2 as apparent from the record of the case was that of a vigilant party.\n  12. The order passed by the trial Court on 15-5-2007 and impugned in this revision, which has undone its earlier illegality is thus maintained but the costs imposed upon the defendant-respondent No.2 in the sum of Rs.2,000 appears to be too meagre an amount and thus, I enhance the said costs from rupees two thousand to rupees thirty thousand, to be deposited by the defendant-respondent No.2 in the trial Court or in the account of the Provincial Government. Since the suit had been filed in January 1998, therefore the trial Court is directed to conclude the trial as early as possible but not later than one year from the date of passing of this order.\n  H.B.T./214/P Order accordingly.",

An execution of decree was filed on 19-10-2006 whereas setting aside ex parte decree application was filed on 5-12-2005.

Through the impugned order, a review petition filed by the petitioner was dismissed.\n  2. The appellant is engaged in the business of installing and running mechanical gadgets for amusement of children. Respondent No.2 advertised auction of leasehold rights for one year for a play land situated in the Lahore Zoo. The appellant participated in the auction and offered the highest bid of Rs.21,50,000. A letter of approval regarding acceptance of his bid was accordingly issued on 14-6-2008.\n  3. An agreement could not immediately be issued for various reasons. However, after some litigation, Work Order No.1290-A2 was issued in favour of the appellant on 30-9-2008 which was followed by an agreement dated 20-10-2008 between the respondent and the appellant.\n  4. It was clearly mentioned in the agreement that the contract was being awarded for play land/kiddy ride inside Lahore Zoo for the year 2008-2009 w.e.f. 1-10-2008 to 30-6-2009. It was also mentioned in the agreement that it was extendable for another year on payment of 25% extra amount over and above the contract money payable under the existing agreement for 2008-2009. The matter of extension was purely at the discretion of the Zoo Administration and no right was conferred on the contractor in this regard.\n  5. The appellant accepted the terms and conditions of the contract without protest, objection, cavil or demur at any stage. He ran his business at the leased premises for the entire term of the agreement, which expired, on 30-6-2009. On expiry: of the aforesaid term, he moved an application under clause 3 of the Agreement seeking extension of the Agreement for another year. He also offered to pay 25% extra as stipulated in the said clause:\n  6. His proposal was considered by the Zoo Maintenance Committee. It was decided not to continue activities in the play land/kiddy ride because these activities were causing harassment to the inhabitants of the Zoo and polluting its atmosphere. The appellant was accordingly informed and extension of the Agreement was declined.\n  7. The appellant filed writ petition No.13539/2009 before this Court. His stance was that he was entitled to extension of atleast three months because he was given a period of only nine months which was contrary to the terms mentioned in the advertisement that had appeared in the newspapers and the understanding given to him, on the basis of which he had submitted his bid. He also submitted that he had paid for a whole year but got only a month to run his business at the leased premises. He also claimed a right for extension of the Agreement for another year on the plea that he had invested substantial sums of money on installation of the gadgets and equipment. His offer to increase the lease money by 25% entitled him to such extension.\n  8. The writ petition did not succeed. The learned Single Judge inter alia held that after having agreed to the terms mentioned in the agreement as well as the work order, and having acted upon them, the petitioner was estopped from objecting to the same. Further, the appellant could not impose himself on the respondents who could not be forced to extend the agreement for another period, against the advice of the Zoo Maintenance Committee.\n  9. The order of the learned Single Judge was not assailed in appeal. However, subsequently a review petition was filed on 15-7-2009. The review petition was dismissed vide the order impugned before us.\n  10. The sole ground agitated in the review petition was that the appellant had been discriminated against. It was argued that in circumstances similar to that of the appellant lease agreements had been extended in favour of other similarly placed contractors including those in favour of contractors running a cafeteria and a simulator elephant.\n  11. The plea of alleged discrimination did not find favour with the learned Single Judge hearing the review petition. He held that the case of the appellant was not at par with that of the other contractors. The Zoo Committee had reported that the kiddy ride/play land was creating harassment for the inhabitants of the zoo and polluting the atmosphere of the Zoo. There was no such report regarding the other contractors. The learned Single Judge, therefore, proceeded to hold that the case of the appellant was distinguishable and no case of discrimination was made out.\n  12. Through this Intra Court Appeal, the orders dated 9-7-2009 passed in Writ Petition No.13539 of 2009 and 4-9-2009 passed in Review Petition No.90 of 2009 have been assailed. As observed earlier, the appellant did not challenge the order dated 9-7-2009. As such, the issue settled in the said order have attained finality and cannot be re-opened in these proceedings. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant has also confined his submissions to assail the order dated 4-9-2009 passed by the learned Single Judge in review.\n  13. In the first place, this appeal is barred by time. In his application under section 5 of the Limitation Act, the appellant has not given any sufficient cause for condonation of delay in filing this appeal. The only reason mentioned in the application is that the appellant was out of Lahore in connection with his business, therefore, could not file the appeal within time. This, we are afraid, hardly furnishes sufficient cause for condonation of delay. However, in the interest of justice, we have also heard the learned counsel for the appellant on merits.\n  14. The grounds urged by him are that the learned Single judge did not consider the high-handedness of the Government functionaries who received bid money for one year and allowed the appellant to work for only nine months. The only other ground pressed by him is that the petitioner was discriminated against by the respondents who extended the arguments of other similarly placed contactors but refused to extend his agreement.\n  15. As far as the first contention is concerned, it is an admitted fact that the contract and work order issued in favour of the appellant clearly mentioned that the agreement would commence w.e.f. 1-10-2008 and expire on 30-6-2009. The appellant not only accepted the terms and conditions of the agreement as well as the work order but acted upon them without objection for the entire term of the Agreement. Having accepted the terms, he cannot be allowed at this belated stage to turn around and take a diametrically different stance when his request for extension of-the tenure for another year has been turned down, on the basis of recommendations of an independent Zoo Advisory Committee. Even otherwise, there was no vested right of further extension, which as clearly stated in the agreement was solely at the option of the respondent.' The option to refuse extension was exercised for valid reasons.\n  16. The second contention of the appellant is equally ill founded. The appellant acquiesced in reduction of the tenure by accepting the work order and signing the agreement without objection. That was not all, he enjoyed the benefits of the lease for nine months and raised an objection only when his application for grant of extension of the lease for an additional year was turned down. The learned counsel has not succeeded in persuading us nor has he brought to our attention any material that may even remotely suggest discrimination, favouritism or high-handedness on the part of Government functionaries associated with this matter.\n  17. We do not find any error in the findings of the learned Single Judge to the effect that there was no discrimination, the case of the appellant was not at par with that of the other contractors and that his case was clearly distinguishable.\n  18. Even otherwise, review has a very limited scope. It may be exercised in the event of discovery of new matter of evidence, which, after exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the appellant or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made. It may also be exercised on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record. Reference can usefully be made to PLD 1998 SC 363 and 2003 SCMR 1501.\n  19. The Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan has consistently held that review proceedings cannot partake rehearing of a decided case. Existence of one or more of the conditions discussed above is sine qua non for exercise of power of review. A party cannot be permitted to convert a review petition into an appeal. Further, the main object of the power of review is to enable a Court to correct its own mistake or error, to prevent injustice. No such mistake or error in the order of the learned Single Judge was pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant. In addition the learned counsel for the appellant has not been able to demonstrate existence of any of the grounds mentioned above that may have necessitated review of the original order dated 9-7-2009.\n  20. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any merit in this appeal. It is accordingly dismissed in limine.\n  M.U.Y./I-3/L Appeal dismissed.",

No such mistake or error in the order of the learned Single Judge was pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant. In addition the learned counsel for the appellant has not been able to demonstrate existence of any of the grounds mentioned above that may have necessitated review of the original order dated 9-7-2009.\n  20. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any merit in this appeal. It is accordingly dismissed in limine.\n  M.U.Y./I-3/L Appeal dismissed.",
      "case_proceddings": "It was clearly mentioned in the agreement that the contract was being awarded for play land/kiddy ride inside Lahore Zoo for the year 2008-2009 w.e.f. 1-10-2008 to 30-6-2009. It was also mentioned in the agreement that it was extendable for another year on payment of 25% extra amount over and above the contract money payable under the existing agreement for 2008-2009. The matter of extension was purely at the discretion of the Zoo Administration and no right was conferred on the contractor in this regard.\n  5. The appellant accepted the terms and conditions of the contract without protest, objection, cavil or demur at any stage. He ran his business at the leased premises for the entire term of the agreement, which expired, on 30-6-2009. On expiry: of the aforesaid term, he moved an application under clause 3 of the Agreement seeking extension of the Agreement for another year. He also offered to pay 25% extra as stipulated in the said clause:\n  6. His proposal was considered by the Zoo Maintenance Committee. It was decided not to continue activities in the play land/kiddy ride because these activities were causing harassment to the inhabitants of the Zoo and polluting its atmosphere. The appellant was accordingly informed and extension of the Agreement was declined.\n  7. The appellant filed writ petition No.13539/2009 before this Court. His stance was that he was entitled to extension of atleast three months because he was given a period of only nine months which was contrary to the terms mentioned in the advertisement that had appeared in the newspapers and the understanding given to him, on the basis of which he had submitted his bid. He also submitted that he had paid for a whole year but got only a month to run his business at the leased premises. He also claimed a right for extension of the Agreement for another year on the plea that he had invested substantial sums of money on installation of the gadgets and equipment. His offer to increase the lease money by 25% entitled him to such extension.\n  8. The writ petition did not succeed. The learned Single Judge inter alia held that after having agreed to the terms mentioned in the agreement as well as the work order, and having acted upon them, the petitioner was estopped from objecting to the same. Further, the appellant could not impose himself on the respondents who could not be forced to extend the agreement for another period, against the advice of the Zoo Maintenance Committee.\n  9. The order of the learned Single Judge was not assailed in appeal. However, subsequently a review petition was filed on 15-7-2009. The review petition was dismissed vide the order impugned before us.\n  10. The sole ground agitated in the review petition was that the appellant had been discriminated against. It was argued that in circumstances similar to that of the appellant lease agreements had been extended in favour of other similarly placed contractors including those in favour of contractors running a cafeteria and a simulator elephant.\n  11. The plea of alleged discrimination did not find favour with the learned Single Judge hearing the review petition. He held that the case of the appellant was not at par with that of the other contractors. The Zoo Committee had reported that the kiddy ride/play land was creating harassment for the inhabitants of the zoo and polluting the atmosphere of the Zoo. There was no such report regarding the other contractors. The learned Single Judge, therefore, proceeded to hold that the case of the appellant was distinguishable and no case of discrimination was made out.\n  12. Through this Intra Court Appeal, the orders dated 9-7-2009 passed in Writ Petition No.13539 of 2009 and 4-9-2009 passed in Review Petition No.90 of 2009 have been assailed. As observed earlier, the appellant did not challenge the order dated 9-7-2009. As such, the issue settled in the said order have attained finality and cannot be re-opened in these proceedings. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant has also confined his submissions to assail the order dated 4-9-2009 passed by the learned Single Judge in review.\n  13. In the first place, this appeal is barred by time. In his application under section 5 of the Limitation Act, the appellant has not given any sufficient cause for condonation of delay in filing this appeal. The only reason mentioned in the application is that the appellant was out of Lahore in connection with his business, therefore, could not file the appeal within time. This, we are afraid, hardly furnishes sufficient cause for condonation of delay. However, in the interest of justice, we have also heard the learned counsel for the appellant on merits.\n  14. The grounds urged by him are that the learned Single judge did not consider the high-handedness of the Government functionaries who received bid money for one year and allowed the appellant to work for only nine months. The only other ground pressed by him is that the petitioner was discriminated against by the respondents who extended the arguments of other similarly placed contactors but refused to extend his agreement.\n  15. As far as the first contention is concerned, it is an admitted fact that the contract and work order issued in favour of the appellant clearly mentioned that the agreement would commence w.e.f. 1-10-2008 and expire on 30-6-2009. The appellant not only accepted the terms and conditions of the agreement as well as the work order but acted upon them without objection for the entire term of the Agreement. Having accepted the terms, he cannot be allowed at this belated stage to turn around and take a diametrically different stance when his request for extension of-the tenure for another year has been turned down, on the basis of recommendations of an independent Zoo Advisory Committee. Even otherwise, there was no vested right of further extension, which as clearly stated in the agreement was solely at the option of the respondent.' The option to refuse extension was exercised for valid reasons.\n  16. The second contention of the appellant is equally ill founded. The appellant acquiesced in reduction of the tenure by accepting the work order and signing the agreement without objection. That was not all, he enjoyed the benefits of the lease for nine months and raised an objection only when his application for grant of extension of the lease for an additional year was turned down. The learned counsel has not succeeded in persuading us nor has he brought to our attention any material that may even remotely suggest discrimination, favouritism or high-handedness on the part of Government functionaries associated with this matter.\n  17. We do not find any error in the findings of the learned Single Judge to the effect that there was no discrimination, the case of the appellant was not at par with that of the other contractors and that his case was clearly distinguishable.\n  18. Even otherwise, review has a very limited scope. It may be exercised in the event of discovery of new matter of evidence, which, after exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the appellant or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made. It may also be exercised on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record. Reference can usefully be made to PLD 1998 SC 363 and 2003 SCMR 1501.\n",

The brief facts are that respondent-plaintiff filed a suit for recovery of Rs.1,00,000 along with counsel fee of Rs.10,000 against Mehrdin, predecessor of petitioners.\n  3. The suit was contested by the defendants by filing written statement which resulted in seven issues. On 7-2-2007 evidence of the plaintiff was recorded and concluded and the case was fixed for evidence of the defendants. On 24-2-2007 evidence of the defendants was absent, therefore, chance was given on payment of cost of Rs.200. On 16-3-2007 defendants' evidence was not available, therefore, notice under Order XVII, rule 3, C.P.0 was given and the case was fixed for evidence on 2-4-2007. It is also on the record that on 2-4-2007 defendant and his evidence was not available and as a result, his right of defence was struck off and case fixed for arguments and order. On 26-4-2007 after hearing arguments, the suit of the respondent-plaintiff was decreed against the defendants vide judgment and decree dated 26-4-2007.\n  4. Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that no sufficient opportunity was given to the defendants for recording his evidence and therefore, the petitioners were condemned unheard.

In my opinion, the Court could not pass such an order in the absence of the defendant. The Court could only pass such order in the presence of the party and in case of non-availability of the evidence. Only two chances have been given and thereafter provisions of Order XVII, rule 3, C.P.C. were pressed into service. Moreover, the impugned judgment reveals that the learned trial Court has not discussed and appreciated the evidence of the plaintiff. The absence of defendant's evidence does not mean that whatever is produced by the plaintiff in the shape of evidence is to be believed. It is the duty of the Court to assess and examine the evidence and thereafter form an opinion.

Badar for Respondent.\n  Date of hearing: 27th October, 2009.\n    JUDGMENT\n  SHAHID ANWAR BAJWA, J.--- The facts giving rise to this petition are that respondents are landlords and the petitioners are tenants. The demised premises is B-10/24 Bazar Area, Madinabad, Clifton Cantonment, Karachi. Tenancy commenced in 1973. On or about 31-5-2004 Rent Application No.44/2004 was filed by the respondent against the appellant. It was stated in the ejectment application that tenant paid rent till December 2001 and thereafter refused to pay rent despite repeated demands. It was also alleged that the demised premises had been sublet without permission of the landlord. It was further pleaded that the applicants were homeless and thus required the demised premises for bona fide need and personal occupation. Rent case was allowed by the Rent Controller on the ground of bona fide personal need and default. Ground of subletting was rejected. Consequently vide order dated 28-4-2007 rent application was allowed and the present appellants were directed to handover vacant physical possession to the present respondent within 30 days.\n  2. Being aggrieved by the order this First Appeal has been filed. Learned counsel for the appellants made the following submissions:--\n  (1) In 1973 when the premises were taken on rent rate of rent was fixed at Rs.50 per month. There was a settlement between the tenant and landlady, predecessor-in-interest of the respondents that rent will be increased by Rs.50 per annum and monthly rate of rent came to Rs.1,000 in November, 2002. The landlady received rent till November 2002. She expired in December, 2002 and thereafter the present respondents refused to receive rent.\n  (2) There was an oral agreement between the landlady and the tenant. In pursuance of this agreement an amount of Rs.50,000 was paid to the ,landlady/predecessor-in-interest of the respondent and it was agreed that there would be no further increase in rent. The legal heirs therefore estopped from demanding increase of rent.\n  (3) No notice of death of the predecessor-in-interest was given. It was incumbent upon the respondent to give such notice. However, in January 2003 one of the legal heirs called the tenant and asked him not to pay rent as there was some dispute going on between the legal heirs as to who will receive rent. Consequently .tenant stopped paying rent. However, with effect on 16-10-2003, the tenant deposited arrears of rent in MRC and continued doing so thereafter at the rate of Rs.1,000 per month.\n  (4) Learned counsel referred to rent accounts submitted by the present respondent in Court below where they had stated increase of Rs.50 per year. Learned counsel contended that in terms of oral agreement they were not liable to increase rent after having paid Rs.50,000 to the predecessor-in-interest of the present respondents.\n  (5) Personal bona fide need has not been established in the Court below. Moreover, the premises is about in an area of 61 Sq.yds, and how can a well-to-do person like the respondent stay in such a small cubby hole. Learned counsel for the appellant relied upon PLD 1981 Kar. 170, PLD 1996 SC 724, PLD 2006 Lail: 684 and 2005 CLC 564.\n  3. Learned counsel for the respondents made the following submissions:\n  (1) There was no verbal agreement by their mother/predecessor-in- interest and neither she received payment of Rs.50,000.\n  (2) Appellant himself has stated that the present respondent informed him about the death of the mother. However, statement by the present appellant that he was directed not to pay rent is false and baseless.\n  (3) Learned counsel referred to written agreement dated 23-12-1990 by which it was agreed that the rent shall be increased by Rs.50 per annum. He submitted that in presence of written agreement no oral assertion can be allowed to be advanced or believed.\n  4. I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel. I have gone through the case law referred as well as record and proceedings of the rent case.\n  Learned trial Court framed the following issues:-\n  \"(1) Whether the petitioner required the demised premises for his personal bona fide need?\n  (2) Whether the respondent committed wilful default in tendering the monthly rent w.e.f. January 2002, onwards?\n  (3) What is rate of rent?\n  (4) Whether the respondent No.1 sublet the demised premises to the respondent No.2, if so, its effect?\n  (5) Relief?\"\n  5. On personal bona fide need the landlord in his ejectment application in para.7 stated that he was homeless and required demised premises for his bona fide personal use and occupation. In his affidavit -in-evidence, he repeated the same. When he came up for cross-examination on this particular aspect he stated that he was residing at Dehli Mercantile Society and that house belongs to his maternal uncle. He further stated that the house situated in Karachi Administrative Employees Cooperative Housing Society, was inherited by him from his mother and he was running his shop of artificial jewelry. The petitioner has not been able to point out as to whether the respondent was in occupation of any premises owned by him. Respondent had clearly stated that he was living with his maternal uncle and needed the demised premises for his personal bona fide need. Emphasis of the petitioner was that area of the plot on which the particular flat is only 61 sq.yds, which cannot be sufficient for need of a person of the status of the respondent.\n  6. It is not for the Court or for the opponent to decide as to what should be the premises suitable for need of the landlord. It is sole exclusive and absolute discretion of the landlord to decide whether which premises or which part of the premiers would be suitable to his requirements. In this regard neither the Court nor the opponent can be allowed to supplant the opinion of the landlord. In this case the landlord had clearly stated that he is living with his uncle. No one can be denied the right to live in his owned premises. Therefore on this score the conclusion reached by the learned Court below cannot be disturbed.\n  7. The second issue related to default and rate of rent. Written agreement dated 23-12-1990 was produced which stated that rent from January to December 1997 shall be at Rs.900 per month and thereafter there will be increase of Rs.50 per month per annum. This agreement has not been denied. What has been stated by the appellant is that there was another oral agreement with his mother and predecessor-in-interest of the landlords and she was paid Rs.50,000. In cross-examination the appellant petitioner stated that he had no written receipt of payment of Rs.50,000 nor any written proof to show cancellation of agreement dated 23-12-1990. In the absence of any proof with him regarding payment of Rs.50,000 to deceased Mst. Najma Saleem or any agreement with her, mere word of the opponent cannot be taken as proof. Rent accounts were filed and in terms of the agreement dated 23-12-1990 the rate of rent for the period from January, 2003 to December, 2003 came to Rs.1,200 per month and thereafter from January to May, 2004 rate would be Rs.1,250 per month. It is not the case of the appellant that he paid at this rate. The Appellant's sole reliance is that the deceased landlady had received Rs.50,000 and entered into an oral agreement for maintaining rent at Rs.1,000 per month. Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon Ali Muhammad Khan's case where it was held that it is not necessary to constitute a void contract that every agreement be in writing. Even oral agreement can also be as valid and as legal and as binding as a written agreement. However, in the same judgment the learned Court has held that an oral agreement in order to be valid required to be proved and such an agreement for proof requires clearest and most satisfactory evidence. Not a single witness has been produced to state that the Rs.50,000 was paid to the predecessor-in-interest of the respondents. In fact co-tenant clearly stated that payment was made by the first tenant. The first tenant stated that he had no written documents with him and no proof to establish that Rs.50,000 was paid by him. Same is the position of the alleged oral agreement with the deceased lady. In Malik Nazar Hussain's case it was held that contract of tenancy does not abate or expire with death of the party. Arfan Hameed's case is on the point of promissory estoppel. None of these cases help case of the appellant. In the present case, very existence of the oral agreement and very existence of payment of Rs.50,000 has not been proved. Therefore, rate of rent would be governed by agreement dated 23-12-1990. Default is established on both scores: in terms of rate as well as by first deposit having been made in MRC in October 2003. The order passed by the trial Court is in consonance with the evidence produced before the Court.\n  Consequently, this appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.\n  M.H./Y-11/K Appeal dismissed.",

      "case_facts": "The facts giving rise to this petition are that respondents are landlords and the petitioners are tenants. The demised premises is B-10/24 Bazar Area, Madinabad, Clifton Cantonment, Karachi. Tenancy commenced in 1973. On or about 31-5-2004 Rent Application No.44/2004 was filed by the respondent against the appellant. It was stated in the ejectment application that tenant paid rent till December 2001 and thereafter refused to pay rent despite repeated demands. It was also alleged that the demised premises had been sublet without permission of the landlord. It was further pleaded that the applicants were homeless and thus required the demised premises for bona fide need and personal occupation. Rent case was allowed by the Rent Controller on the ground of bona fide personal need and default. Ground of subletting was rejected. Consequently vide order dated 28-4-2007 rent application was allowed and the present appellants were directed to handover vacant physical possession to the present respondent within 30 days.",

      "case_proceddings": "Being aggrieved by the order this First Appeal has been filed. Learned counsel for the appellants made the following submissions:--\n  (1) In 1973 when the premises were taken on rent rate of rent was fixed at Rs.50 per month. There was a settlement between the tenant and landlady, predecessor-in-interest of the respondents that rent will be increased by Rs.50 per annum and monthly rate of rent came to Rs.1,000 in November, 2002. The landlady received rent till November 2002. She expired in December, 2002 and thereafter the present respondents refused to receive rent.\n  (2) There was an oral agreement between the landlady and the tenant. In pursuance of this agreement an amount of Rs.50,000 was paid to the ,landlady/predecessor-in-interest of the respondent and it was agreed that there would be no further increase in rent. The legal heirs therefore estopped from demanding increase of rent.\n  (3) No notice of death of the predecessor-in-interest was given. It was incumbent upon the respondent to give such notice. However, in January 2003 one of the legal heirs called the tenant and asked him not to pay rent as there was some dispute going on between the legal heirs as to who will receive rent. Consequently .tenant stopped paying rent. However, with effect on 16-10-2003, the tenant deposited arrears of rent in MRC and continued doing so thereafter at the rate of Rs.1,000 per month.\n  (4) Learned counsel referred to rent accounts submitted by the present respondent in Court below where they had stated increase of Rs.50 per year. Learned counsel contended that in terms of oral agreement they were not liable to increase rent after having paid Rs.50,000 to the predecessor-in-interest of the present respondents.\n  (5) Personal bona fide need has not been established in the Court below. Moreover, the premises is about in an area of 61 Sq.yds, and how can a well-to-do person like the respondent stay in such a small cubby hole. Learned counsel for the appellant relied upon PLD 1981 Kar. 170, PLD 1996 SC 724, PLD 2006 Lail: 684 and 2005 CLC 564.\n  3. Learned counsel for the respondents made the following submissions:\n  (1) There was no verbal agreement by their mother/predecessor-in- interest and neither she received payment of Rs.50,000.\n  (2) Appellant himself has stated that the present respondent informed him about the death of the mother. However, statement by the present appellant that he was directed not to pay rent is false and baseless.\n  (3) Learned counsel referred to written agreement dated 23-12-1990 by which it was agreed that the rent shall be increased by Rs.50 per annum. He submitted that in presence of written agreement no oral assertion can be allowed to be advanced or believed.\n  4. I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel. I have gone through the case law referred as well as record and proceedings of the rent case.\n  Learned trial Court framed the following issues:-\n  \"(1) Whether the petitioner required the demised premises for his personal bona fide need?\n  (2) Whether the respondent committed wilful default in tendering the monthly rent w.e.f. January 2002, onwards?\n  (3) What is rate of rent?\n  (4) Whether the respondent No.1 sublet the demised premises to the respondent No.2, if so, its effect?\n  (5) Relief?\"\n  5. On personal bona fide need the landlord in his ejectment application in para.7 stated that he was homeless and required demised premises for his bona fide personal use and occupation. In his affidavit -in-evidence, he repeated the same. When he came up for cross-examination on this particular aspect he stated that he was residing at Dehli Mercantile Society and that house belongs to his maternal uncle. He further stated that the house situated in Karachi Administrative Employees Cooperative Housing Society, was inherited by him from his mother and he was running his shop of artificial jewelry. The petitioner has not been able to point out as to whether the respondent was in occupation of any premises owned by him. Respondent had clearly stated that he was living with his maternal uncle and needed the demised premises for his personal bona fide need. Emphasis of the petitioner was that area of the plot on which the particular flat is only 61 sq.yds, which cannot be sufficient for need of a person of the status of the respondent.\n  6. It is not for the Court or for the opponent to decide as to what should be the premises suitable for need of the landlord. It is sole exclusive and absolute discretion of the landlord to decide whether which premises or which part of the premiers would be suitable to his requirements. In this regard neither the Court nor the opponent can be allowed to supplant the opinion of the landlord. In this case the landlord had clearly stated that he is living with his uncle. No one can be denied the right to live in his owned premises. Therefore on this score the conclusion reached by the learned Court below cannot be disturbed.\n  7. The second issue related to default and rate of rent. Written agreement dated 23-12-1990 was produced which stated that rent from January to December 1997 shall be at Rs.900 per month and thereafter there will be increase of Rs.50 per month per annum. This agreement has not been denied. What has been stated by the appellant is that there was another oral agreement with his mother and predecessor-in-interest of the landlords and she was paid Rs.50,000. In cross-examination the appellant petitioner stated that he had no written receipt of payment of Rs.50,000 nor any written proof to show cancellation of agreement dated 23-12-1990. In the absence of any proof with him regarding payment of Rs.50,000 to deceased Mst. Najma Saleem or any agreement with her, mere word of the opponent cannot be taken as proof. Rent accounts were filed and in terms of the agreement dated 23-12-1990 the rate of rent for the period from January, 2003 to December, 2003 came to Rs.1,200 per month and thereafter from January to May, 2004 rate would be Rs.1,250 per month. It is not the case of the appellant that he paid at this rate. The Appellant's sole reliance is that the deceased landlady had received Rs.50,000 and entered into an oral agreement for maintaining rent at Rs.1,000 per month. Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon Ali Muhammad Khan's case where it was held that it is not necessary to constitute a void contract that every agreement be in writing. Even oral agreement can also be as valid and as legal and as binding as a written agreement.",

NAEEM MASOOD, J.--- I intend to dispose of Civil Revision No.1024 of 2002, Civil Revision No.1025 of 2002 and Writ Petition No.659 of 2008 through this single judgment as all the petitions involve the same facts and law and are between the same parties.\n  2. Briefly put the facts of the case, in chronological order, are that on 2-8-1993 the petitioner/plaintiff filed a suit for declaration that the plaintiff has wagon stand constructed over Khasra No.50/23 on the land measuring 16 Marlas, situated (On Pacca Road South East corner) in Mailsi City and that the respondent Railway Authorities have no concern with his construction and that the order dated 21-6-1993 passed by respondent No.2 General Manager, Pakistan Railways about demolishing the construction is illegal and the defendants Railway Authorities may be restrained to demolish the construction. It was further submitted that the construction of wagon stand of the plaintiff was in Khasra No.50/23, whereas, Pakistan Railways owns Khasra No.238. It was further asserted that the defendants were all set to demolish the wagon stand of the petitioner without getting the land fully demarcated from the Revenue Authorities.\n  3. The Pakistan Railways contested the suit by filing written statement asserting that the plaintiff was in illegal possession of the land in dispute owned by Pakistan Railways and that the plaintiff/petitioner is neither owner nor lease holder of the land in question and that the land is within 100 feet of railways track, therefore, the same cannot be disposed of to any body under the policy and that any construction over the land in dispute can trigger a serious accident.\n  4. On the pleadings of the parties following issues were framed:---\n  (1) Whether the order dated 21.6-1993 passed by defendant No.2 is illegal, void, ultra vires and ineffective' upon the rights of the plaintiff? OPD.\n  (2) Whether this Court has got no jurisdiction to try this suit? OPD\n  (3) Whether the plaintiff has got no cause of action and locus standi to bring this suit? OPD\n  (4) Whether the plaintiffs are trespassers? OPD\n  (5) Whether the suit is hit by res judicata? OPD\n  (6) Relief.\n  The parties led their, evidence. The plaintiff/petitioner appeared as P.W. and stated that he owned 16 Marlas in Khasra No.50/23 and that the Railways Authorities owned Khasra No.238. He, however, admitted that he was not shown as owner in the ownership column of Jamabandi Exh.P.3 and. admitted that the land is for welfare of people (Mufade-aam).\n  The defendants produced Syed Ashiq Hussain Bukhari D.W-1 who stated that Pakistan Railways had no concern with Khasra No.50/23 and this Khasra belongs to Committee and that Pakistan Railways owns Khasra No.238 over which plaintiff has constructed wagon stand in question and that the plaintiff is in illegal possession of the land of Pakistan Railways.\n  5. On 2-11-1993 the learned counsel of Pakistan Railways made a statement that Khasra No.50/23 is not owned by the Railway Authorities and it has no concern with it. On the same date i.e. 2-1.1-1993, the learned counsel of petitioner/plaintiff made a statement that Khasra No.50/23 is not owned by the petitioner/plaintiff and rather it is for welfare of public (Mufade-aam) and is in possession of the petitioner/plaintiff.\n  6. On 12-7-1994 the learned counsel of Pakistan Railways made a statement that Pakistan Railways had no concern with Khasra No.50/23 and that Railways Authorities is owner of Khasra No.238. After getting the demarcation of Khasra No.50/23 they will not interfere in the possession of the petitioner/plaintiff.\n  7. The learned counsel of petitioner/plaintiff made a statement that the suit may be admitted because of commitment made by the learned counsel of Pakistan Railways.\n  8. On this the learned trial Court passed an order on the same date that the suit is dismissed as withdrawn in accordance with the statement of the learned counsel of Pakistan Railways that they will not interfere in the possession of the plaintiff.\n  9. The above narration is made to show that the demarcation of the land in question was sine qua non in the matter.\n  10. The demarcation was not followed to be made by either party. Instead application for contempt was made by petitioner against the respondents. Reply was submitted. On the evidence of the parties the following operative order was passed by the learned Senior Civil Judge, Vehari on 11-12-2001.\n  \"I, therefore, decide this issue in favour of the petitioner with the direction that the respondents will not interfere in the area comprising Khasra No.50/23 measuring 16 Marlas where the petitioner has constructed this wagon stand as it was constructed prior to its demolish and hereby attach the property of the Railway Department adjacent to the disputed property till implementation of the order. The issue is decided in favour of the petitioner accordingly.\"\n  11. Against the above said order two appeals one by Pakistan Railways and other by Khan Brothers were filed before the learned Additional District Judge, Vehari who vide two orders dated 13-9-2002ID passed the following operative order:---\n  \"In the above said circumstances both the appeals are accepted and the case is remanded to the trial Court with the direction that it will get the demarcation conducted by the - Revenue Authorities in presence of parties between Khewat Nos.238 and 50/23 above mentioned to ascertain that on which of the two Khewats the constructions were made by the respondents and demolished by the appellants. The trial Court for the ascertainment of the above said position can record further evidence, if required. The trial Court is directed to decide again the contempt application in accordance with law. The impugned order is set aside. The parties are directed to appear before the trial Court on 28-9-2002.\"\n  12. Against the above order Civil Revisions Nos.1024 of 2002 and 1025 of 2002 have been filed.\n  13. The learned counsel of the petitioner vehemently contends that the impugned order suffers from illegality as the learned lower appellate Court itself could record the evidence and that trustworthy evidence of the petitioner has not been properly appreciated.\n  14. Learned counsel of Pakistan Railways and learned counsel of respondent No.6 as well as learned Assistant Advocate General have strongly supported the impugned order to be just and fair.\n  15. I have considered the arguments advanced from four corners and have perused the record.\n  16. The learned appellate Court's direction that the demarcation to be made first of all is quite in consonance with the statement of the learned' counsel of Pakistan Railways in the suit on 12-7-1994 that demarcation shall be sine qua non to the further relationship between the parties. This statement was accepted by the learned counsel of the petitioner on 12-7-1994 and the suit was permitted to be withdrawn in the light of the reciprocal commitments.\n  17. Without resorting to the full-fledged demarcation of Khasra No.50/23 and Khasra No.238 (adjacent to each other), it was impossible to determine the respective claims of the parties. Hence, the impugned order is just, fair, equitable and reasonable and does not invoke any interference.\n  18. Besides no illegality or material irregularity has been shown to have been committed in the impugned order.\n  19. Consequently, Civil Revision No.1024 of 2002 and Civil Revision 1025 of 2002 are dismissed. The impugned order dated 13-9-2002 is upheld. The Writ Petition No.3659 of 2008 is also dismissed as the same also challenges the proposal for joint demarcation of disputed land.\n  20. The parties are at litigation since 1993. Both the parties have reasonable interest in the property in dispute. Hence to add to the transparency, the learned Senior Civil Judge, Vehari shall direct the learned Senior Member, Board of Revenue, Punjab to constitute a committee of three responsible Revenue Officers headed by a Grade-19 Revenue Officer to conduct fair and meticulously transparent demarcation of Khasra No.50/23 and Khasra No.238 in question and to submit a report to that effect to the learned Senior Civil Judge within two months. The case shall preferably be decided within four months.\n  21. The parties are directed to appear before the learned Senior Civil Judge, Vehari on 29-6-2009.\n  M.U.Y./S-199/L Petition dismissed.",

The learned counsel of the petitioner vehemently contends that the impugned order suffers from illegality as the learned lower appellate Court itself could record the evidence and that trustworthy evidence of the petitioner has not been properly appreciated.\n  14. Learned counsel of Pakistan Railways and learned counsel of respondent No.6 as well as learned Assistant Advocate General have strongly supported the impugned order to be just and fair.\n  15. I have considered the arguments advanced from four corners and have perused the record.\n  16. The learned appellate Court's direction that the demarcation to be made first of all is quite in consonance with the statement of the learned' counsel of Pakistan Railways in the suit on 12-7-1994 that demarcation shall be sine qua non to the further relationship between the parties. This statement was accepted by the learned counsel of the petitioner on 12-7-1994 and the suit was permitted to be withdrawn in the light of the reciprocal commitments.\n  17. Without resorting to the full-fledged demarcation of Khasra No.50/23 and Khasra No.238 (adjacent to each other), it was impossible to determine the respective claims of the parties. Hence, the impugned order is just, fair, equitable and reasonable and does not invoke any interference.\n  18. Besides no illegality or material irregularity has been shown to have been committed in the impugned order.\n  19. Consequently, Civil Revision No.1024 of 2002 and Civil Revision 1025 of 2002 are dismissed. The impugned order dated 13-9-2002 is upheld. The Writ Petition No.3659 of 2008 is also dismissed as the same also challenges the proposal for joint demarcation of disputed land.",

The suit of the plaintiff was decreed in the shape of different observations against the defendants. Against the said decree of Civil Judge, Hangu two Appeals bearing No.21/31 of 2003 titled Noor Dil v. Muhammad and Appeal No.25/13 titled Muhammad v. Gul Rehman and others, were filed. The District Judge Hangu dismissed the appeal of the plaintiff i.e. Appeal No.21/13 and allowed the connected Appeal bearing No.25/13 by dismissing the suit of the plaintiffs Gul Rehman etc. Hence the present Revision.\n  5. It is strange to note that there are two civil revisions C.R. No.586 of 2003 titled Noor Dil and others v. Muhammad and others and Civil Revision No.588 of 2003 titled Gul Rehman and others v. Muhammad and others both have been filed by the plaintiffs of the main case. This situation was also put forth by this Court in a hearing vide its order dated 1-12-2008 and learned counsel for the petitioner had requested for some time to meet the situation.\n  6. Today, once again, during the hearing, the learned counsel for the petitioners was unable to justify the filing of two revision petitions against the judgment and decree of the appellate. Court by the same party by simply submitting to be an inadvertent mistake. While considering the present state of affairs, this Court having no option but to dismiss the subsequent revision petition i.e. Civil Revision No.588 of 2003 being unnecessary and without justification which is dismissed as such.\n  7. The learned two Courts below have, to the best of their ability, tried to decide the matter as reflected in their judgments but as far as the legal aspect of the matter in dispute is concerned that needs to be resolved in accordance with the law.\n  8. In this case, ownership of the property lies in the name of Provincial Government since the availability of the revenue record and Gul Rehman and other the plaintiffs are recorded as occupancy tenants of the same since their forefathers. No doubt, in one or two `Jamabandies' they have been recorded as tenants at will but in the subsequent Jamabandies their status as that of occupancy tenants was rectified and it seems to be an inadvertent mistake of the officials concerned and later on these mistakes were rightly rectified during the preparation of subsequent Jamabandies.\n  9. As far as, the entries in the name of defendants Nos.1 to 3 regarding the above said Khasra numbers are concerned, same get no support from the revenue record and evidence produced by the defendants. The entries made in their names are not in accordance with the record and have unlawfully been substituted which are hereby declared against the record and the defendants No.1 to 3 have got no concern with the possession of Khasra numbers referred to above as tenants-at-will, such entries: need rectification. This being the factual position of the case as reflected in the revenue record but as far as the status of the plaintiff as occupancy tenants is concerned, certain questions are hereby framed in this regard.\n  (iI) Whether after promulgation N.-W.F.P Tenancy Act, 1950, the plaintiffs would still be able to claim their status as that of occupancy tenants under section 3 of the Act?\n  (ii) In presence of case law given by the Shariat Appellate Bench of august Supreme Court of Pakistan in Shariat Appeal No.16/84 dated 10-8-1989 titled' Sultan Khan v. Government of N.-W.F.P. and Review Petition No.2-R of 1989 dated 7-5-1991 titled Sardar Muhammad Yousaf v. Government of Pakistan what would be the legal status of the plaintiffs being recorded as. occupancy tenants?\n  10. The N.-W.F.P. Tenancy Act, 1950 (hereinafter to be referred as the Act) was promulgated on 3rd July, 1950 and was made applicable to the whole of the N.-W.F.P. Section-3 of which provides that after the commencement of this act no person whether he is a tenant or not can acquire, have or continue to have a right of occupancy in any land under any enactment, contract, decree or order of any Court or officer which clearly reflects that after the promulgation of the Act ibid no one can claim himself to be the occupancy tenant of the land. For ready reference section 3 is reproduced as under:---\n  Non-acquisition of occupancy rights.--- Subject to the provisions of this Act no person whether a tenant or not, shall after the commencement of this Act, acquire, have or continue to have a right of occupancy in any land under any enactment contract, decree or order of any Court or Officer.\n  11. The case of the plaintiff/petitioner is only to the extent that entries in their names as occupancy tenants be rectified and names of the defendants appearing as tenants at will be declared as unlawful having no support from the record or the spot. However, after the commencement of the Act, occupancy tenants were given a right under section 4 to become owner of the property within the parameters given in the said section. The provisions of section-4 read with N.-W.F.P Tenancy (Fixation of Compensation to Landlords) Rules, 1981 (hereinafter to be called as Rules) were declared against the injunction of Islam by the Shariat Appellate Bench of august Supreme Court in Shariat Appeal No.16 of 1984 vide its judgment dated 10-8-1989 reported in (NLR 1990 SD 90) titled Sultan Khan v.. Government of N.-W.F.P. and Review Petition No.2-R of 1989 dated 7-5-1991 titled Sardar Muhammad Yousaf v. Government of Pakistan, wherein a target dated of 23rd March of 1990 was given and the Government of N.-W.F.P. was directed to amend section 4 of the Act, otherwise the same will cease to have its effect from the said target date and the person whose cases were dealt with under the provisions of section 4 of the Act prior to the said date were protected and after the said date no one would be able to claim ownership under section 4 of the Act.\n  12. Record of the case reveal that the plaintiffs in the case have failed to avail the concession given time to time by the Provincial Government under section 4 of the Act, now they cannot claim such concessions. By considering the old and long possession, their status over the property would be at the most as that of tenants-at-will and in the circumstances of the case, it is hereby declared that their names be entered as such in the column of cultivation of the Register Haqdaran Zamin in future.\n  13. So this being the legal position of the entries in favour of plaintiff/petitioners as occupancy tenants, there status would only be of a tenant at will after the promulgation of the Act and they cannot also claim ownership of the land under their occupation under the provisions of section 4 which has ceased to have its effect.\n  14. So with the observation made above, question No.1 is answered in negative and answer to question No.2, is that their status would only be that of tenants-at-will.\n  15. With these observations by acceptance of this Revision Petition suit of the plaintiff/petitioner is partially decreed to the extent that entries appearing in the name of defendant/respondent as tenants at will are against the record. However, the plaintiff/petitioner cannot claim themselves to be the occupancy tenants of the said land the their status would only be of tenants-at-will.\n  H.B.T./218/P?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????

Against the said decree of Civil Judge, Hangu two Appeals bearing No.21/31 of 2003 titled Noor Dil v. Muhammad and Appeal No.25/13 titled Muhammad v. Gul Rehman and others, were filed. The District Judge Hangu dismissed the appeal of the plaintiff i.e. Appeal No.21/13 and allowed the connected Appeal bearing No.25/13 by dismissing the suit of the plaintiffs Gul Rehman etc. Hence the present Revision.\n  5. It is strange to note that there are two civil revisions C.R. No.586 of 2003 titled Noor Dil and others v. Muhammad and others and Civil Revision No.588 of 2003 titled Gul Rehman and others v. Muhammad and others both have been filed by the plaintiffs of the main case. This situation was also put forth by this Court in a hearing vide its order dated 1-12-2008 and learned counsel for the petitioner had requested for some time to meet the situation.\n  6. Today, once again, during the hearing, the learned counsel for the petitioners was unable to justify the filing of two revision petitions against the judgment and decree of the appellate.

Government of N.-W.F.P. and Review Petition No.2-R of 1989 dated 7-5-1991 titled Sardar Muhammad Yousaf v. Government of Pakistan what would be the legal status of the plaintiffs being recorded as. occupancy tenants?\n  10. The N.-W.F.P. Tenancy Act, 1950 (hereinafter to be referred as the Act) was promulgated on 3rd July, 1950 and was made applicable to the whole of the N.-W.F.P. Section-3 of which provides that after the commencement of this act no person whether he is a tenant or not can acquire, have or continue to have a right of occupancy in any land under any enactment, contract, decree or order of any Court or officer which clearly reflects that after the promulgation of the Act ibid no one can claim himself to be the occupancy tenant of the land.

The case of the plaintiff/petitioner is only to the extent that entries in their names as occupancy tenants be rectified and names of the defendants appearing as tenants at will be declared as unlawful having no support from the record or the spot. However, after the commencement of the Act, occupancy tenants were given a right under section 4 to become owner of the property within the parameters given in the said section. The provisions of section-4 read with N.-W.F.P Tenancy (Fixation of Compensation to Landlords) Rules, 1981 (hereinafter to be called as Rules) were declared against the injunction of Islam by the Shariat Appellate Bench of august Supreme Court in Shariat Appeal No.16 of 1984 vide its judgment dated 10-8-1989 reported in (NLR 1990 SD 90) titled Sultan Khan v.. Government of N.-W.F.P. and Review Petition No.2-R of 1989 dated 7-5-1991 titled Sardar Muhammad Yousaf v. Government of Pakistan, wherein a target dated of 23rd March of 1990 was given and the Government of N.-W.F.P. was directed to amend section 4 of the Act, otherwise the same will cease to have its effect from the said target date and the person whose cases were dealt with under the provisions of section 4 of the Act prior to the said date were protected and after the said date no one would be able to claim ownership under section 4 of the Act.\n  12. Record of the case reveal that the plaintiffs in the case have failed to avail the concession given time to time by the Provincial Government under section 4 of the Act, now they cannot claim such concessions.

So this being the legal position of the entries in favour of plaintiff/petitioners as occupancy tenants, there status would only be of a tenant at will after the promulgation of the Act and they cannot also claim ownership of the land under their occupation under the provisions of section 4 which has ceased to have its effect.\n  14. So with the observation made above, question No.1 is answered in negative and answer to question No.2, is that their status would only be that of tenants-at-will.",

Petitioner in this case is a tenant since 1960 or so in respect of the area admeasuring 2830 sq. ft. on ground floor of P.I.D.C. House, Dr. Ziauddin Ahmed Road. The rent was last increased in 1982 and thereafter there had not been any increase in rent. Application was filed in April, 1987 for fixation of fair rent at the rate of Rs.10 per Sq. Ft. from the date of the application. The trial Court vide order dated 14-6-2001 allowed the application and determined fair rent at the rate of Rs.10 per sq.ft. with effect from the date of filing of the rent case. Being aggrieved by the order of the trial Court the present petitioner filed appeal before the appellate Court. On 19-11-2004 the appeal was dismissed due to absence of the counsel for the present petitioner. Thereafter present petitioner appellant filed an application for restoration on 31-10-2005. After this application was filed, an application under section 5 of the Limitation Act was filed on 28-1-2006. In this application it was prayed that delay, if any, in filing the application for restoration may be condoned. In the affidavit it was submitted that Mr. Khalid Latif, Advocate for the present petitioner fell seriously ill and therefore, he could neither appear himself nor inform the petitioner about his non-appearance. It was during this period that order dated 19-11-2004 was passed. The petitioner did not know about this order because he, had received no intimation regarding prolonged illness of his former Advocate. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that application for condonation of delay was filed by way of abundant caution because it is Article 181 of the Limitation Act, which is attracted to such a like situation and not Article 168 and therefore, his application for restoration was not barred by time. In this regard he relied upon Yousuf v. Fazal Karim 1983 PLC 2219 and Afzal Begum and another v. Y.M.C.A. through its General Secretary PLD 1979 SC 18. He further submitted that the law favours adjudication on merits rather than on technicalities. Learned counsel for the private respondents submitted that office of the petitioner is located in the same premises where the premises in occupation of the tenant is located\\and for a long time the petitioner did not bother to find out about the case. In such situation, such an indolent person is not entitled to any relaxation by the Courts. He relied upon Zulfiqar Ali v. Lal Din and another 1974 SCMR 162 and Sher Muhammad v. Said Muhammad Shah 1981 SCMR 212. Learned counsel referred to his counter-affidavit filed in the Court below where it was stated that the petitioner was informed by the landlord about dismissal of the appeal.\n  3. I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel. I have also gone through the record as well as the case-law.\n  4. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that Court should decide controversies on the basis of merits rather than technicalities. I cannot agree more with him. I do not think that limitation is a technicality because limitation confers very valuable rights as has been held by the Supreme Court in Imtiaz Ali v. Atta Muhammad and another PLD 2008 SC 462. Therefore, limitation is not a technicality but it confers very valuable rights.\n  5. In Zulfiqar Ali's case which was the matter relating to an application under the Rent Restriction Laws, appeal was dismissed. Subsequently an application for restoration of the appeal was filed. That application was dismissed on merits and it was observed that mere fact that the litigant has engaged the counsel to appear on his behalf does not absolve him of his responsibility. It was further held that it is duty of the litigant as that of the counsel engaged by him to see that litigation was properly and diligently prosecuted. If the counsel engaged is lacking in a sense of responsibility to the Court, it is he who should suffer and not the other side. Sher Muhammad's case is materially on the same point. No cavil with this proposition.\n  6. However, order of the appellate Court below in its deciding para reads as under:---\n  \"It reveals that the above said F.R.A. was dismissed on 19-11-2004 while the present application has been filed on 31-10-2005 and the explanation given in the application for delay is the illness of the counsel, but no any medical certificate has been filed along with application nor even the affidavit of previous counsel is filed. So also application under section 5 of the Limitation Act is not mentioning the delay of each and every date. The responsibility of litigant did not come to an end, as the litigant is required to pursue his case with reasonable diligence and care and supposed to establish contact with his counsel and remained in touch with him in order to find out the result of the case, plea setup for the delay in filing this application did not constitute a valid ground for condonation of delay nor the same is supported with any documentary proof. The application is hopelessly time-barred, accordingly dismissed. So also the application under section 5 of the Limitation Act is dismissed with no order as to costs\".\n  7. Reading of the above para indicates that Court first noticed the plea setup for the delay in filing this application did not constitute a valid ground for condonation of delay nor the same is supported with any documentary proof. The application was held to be hopelessly time barred and therefore, dismissed so was the application under section 5 of the Limitation Act dismissed without any order as to costs.. Perusal of the above order indicates that condonation application was dismissed because no valid ground was given and restoration application was dismissed because it was held to be time barred. Learned counsel for the petitioner placed heavy reliance on Yousuf's case (supra). The facts of that case were that appeals were dismissed for non-prosecution and applications for their readmission/restoration were filed. In one case the appeal was dismissed on 8-9-1981 and. application for restoration was filed on 12-1-1982. The High Court firstly held that although the preamble of the Limitation Act mentions that object of the Act is to consolidate and amend law relating to limitation of suits, appeals and certain applications to Courts a close look on various provisions of Act would show that the provisions of the Act are not restricted in their application to proceedings before the Courts alone. Section 29 of the Act was also noticed where it is provided that where a local or special law provides a period of limitation different from the period prescribed there for in the first schedule to the Act then only some of the provisions of the Act apply but where the period of the limitation prescribed by the special or local law is the same as prescribed in the first schedule of the Act then whole of the Act becomes applicable. Thereafter contention regarding applicability of Article 168 or 181 to such a situation was examined and the following was observed:--\n  \"I will now examine the contention whether Article 168 of the Act applied to an application for restoration of an appeal filed under the Ordinance which was dismissed for default. The Ordinance is admittedly a special as well as a local law within the meaning of section 29 of the Act. It is not disputed that under the Ordinance, the period of limitation, prescribed for filing an appeal before this Court is different from the period prescribed for filing an appeal before this Court is different from the period prescribed therefore, in the 1st Schedule to the Act. In these circumstances, in my humble view only those provisions of the Act which are mentioned in clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 29 of the Act will be applicable and therefore, Article 168 of the Act which prescribes the period for filing of an application for restoration of appeal dismissed for non-appearance will not be attracted. -However, in absence of any specific Article in the Act' being applicable to such applications, the same should be filed within a reasonable time which in my view should be equivalent to the period prescribed in the residuary Article 181 of the Act, as three years. While still on this point I may mention here the case of Afroze Begum v. Y.M.C.A. (1) where the Supreme Court while considering the applicability of Article 169 of the Act as application made for rehearing of an appeal heard ex parte under section 15(4) of the East Pakistan Urban Rent Restriction Ordinance, 1959, held that this Article did not apply to such application which will be governed under Article 181 of the Act. I, therefore, hold that the two applications C.M.A. No.6 of 82 in F.R.A. No.500 of 80 and C.M.A. No.173 of 82 in F.R.A. No.504 of 80 filed for restoration/re-admission of appeals are within time. Having held the applications for restoration/re-admission of appeals within time I will not proceed to examine these applications on merits.\"\n  8. A reference in this judgment had been made to Afzal Begum's case. In that case it was observed as under:---\n  \"Even otherwise Article -169 of the Limitation Act is not in terms attracted to this case. It may be seen that. Article 164 of the Act is applicable to an application by a \"defendant\" for an order to set aside a \"decree\" passed ex parte and the prescribed period of limitation of thirty days starts running from the date of the \"decree\" or, where the \"summons\" was not duly served, when the applicant has knowledge of the \"decree\". In the context it seems that this Article is limited to suits. Likewise under Article 169 of the Act the limitation for an application for rehearing of an appeal heard ex parte is prescribed as thirty days from the date of \"decree\" in appeal, or where notice of the appeal was not duly served, when the applicant has knowledge of the \"decree\". The third column of this Article shows that if is limited to an appeal from a decree and it has no application to an appeal heard ex parte from an appellate order to distinguish it from a decree\".\n  9. It was further observed while concluding as under:--\n  \"In the light of the above discussion I am of the considered opinion that the ejectment order dated 9th of April, 1974 was passed ex parte by the High Court in appeal under section 15(4) of the Urban Rent Restriction Ordinance, 1959. It was not a decree as such and therefore', Article 169 of the Limitation Act was not at all applicable to the application made by the petitioners to set aside the ex parte order and rehearing of the appeal. It was governed by the residuary Article 181 of the Limitation Act and the application for rehearing of the appeal could have been made within three years. The cause of action had accrued to the petitioners on the passing of the ex parte ejectment order on 9-4-1974 and therefore, the application filed by them in the High Court on the 23rd of February, 1978 for rehearing of the appeal was clearly barred by time.\n  10. The above observations makes it very clear that an order passed by the Rent Controller is not a decree and therefore, in matters of appeal against it, for restoration/rehearing of the appeal dismissed for non-prosecution, the applicable Article is 181. Therefore, application for rehearing of the appeal filed before the Appellate Court was not time barred. That was probably the reason that in application for condonation of delay, words \"if any\" had been clearly stated. Since the Appellate Court has not gone into merits of the application for rehearing of the appeal. I, therefore, set aside the impugned order dated 2-11-2006 and remand the matter to the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court shall first decide the application for restoration of appeal within 30 days of the date of receipt of this order and thereafter shall decide the main appeal, if application for restoration is allowed by it, within 30 days thereafter. This Constitution Petition is allowed in the above terms. However, in peculiar circumstances the parties are left to bear their own costs.\n  S.A.K./P-18/K Petition accepted.",

Petitioner in this case is a tenant since 1960 or so in respect of the area admeasuring 2830 sq. ft. on ground floor of P.I.D.C. House, Dr. Ziauddin Ahmed Road. The rent was last increased in 1982 and thereafter there had not been any increase in rent. Application was filed in April, 1987 for fixation of fair rent at the rate of Rs.10 per Sq. Ft. from the date of the application. The trial Court vide order dated 14-6-2001 allowed the application and determined fair rent at the rate of Rs.10 per sq.ft. with effect from the date of filing of the rent case. Being aggrieved by the order of the trial Court the present petitioner filed appeal before the appellate Court. On 19-11-2004 the appeal was dismissed due to absence of the counsel for the present petitioner. Thereafter present petitioner appellant filed an application for restoration on 31-10-2005. After this application was filed, an application under section 5 of the Limitation Act was filed on 28-1-2006. In this application it was prayed that delay, if any, in filing the application for restoration may be condoned. In the affidavit it was submitted that Mr. Khalid Latif, Advocate for the present petitioner fell seriously ill and therefore, he could neither appear himself nor inform the petitioner about his non-appearance. It was during this period that order dated 19-11-2004 was passed. The petitioner did not know about this order because he, had received no intimation regarding prolonged illness of his former Advocate. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that application for condonation of delay was filed by way of abundant caution because it is Article 181 of the Limitation Act, which is attracted to such a like situation and not Article 168 and therefore, his application for restoration was not barred by time. In this regard he relied upon Yousuf v. Fazal Karim 1983 PLC 2219 and Afzal Begum and another v. Y.M.C.A. through its General Secretary PLD 1979 SC 18. He further submitted that the law favours adjudication on merits rather than on technicalities.

NAEEM MASOOD, J.--- The instant civil revision is directed against the judgment and decree dated 17-7-2004, passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Kahroor Pacca;, whereby the judgment and decree dated 31-3-2001, passed by the learned Civil Judge, Kahroor Pacca was set aside.\n  2. The brief facts of the case are that one Azeem died leaving behind six children.\n  Manzoor\nSon\nBakhan Mai\nDaughters\nNoor Mai\n  Maryam Mai\n  Manzoor Mai\n  Nazir Mai\n      The brother Manzoor as at litigation drawn with his sisters. The bone of contention in between the parties is the alleged gift made by the sisters of their inherited land by way of gift to their brother Manzoor and then reflected in mutation No.805 dated 5-7-1987. Mst. Bakhan Mai and Noor Mai filed a suit against their brother Manzoor and Maryam Mai, Manzoor Mai and Nazir Mai being pro forma defendants stating therein that the none of the sisters of Manzoor had made any gift to their brother Manzoor, and the sisters of Manzoor being Pardanashin ladies were defrauded and gift was fraudulent having been obtained through fraud and the fraud was further perpetuated by reflecting the same in Mutation No.805 dated 15-7-1987 with connivance of the Revenue Authorities.\n  The petitioner/defendant No.1 Manzoor Ahmed filed the written statement controverting the facts of the plaint and further submitted that the suit was filed with ulterior motives to harass him. On the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed: ---\n  (1I) Whether the impugned mutation of Gift No.805, dated 15-7-1987 was validly executed in favour of the defendant No.1? OPD-1\n  (2) If the above issue is proved in affirmative the impugned mutation of gift was the result of fraud and misrepresentation and collusion? OPP\n  (3) Whether the instant suit is within time? OPP\n  (4) Whether the instant suit not in proper form? If so, what should be the proper form? OPD-1\n  (5) Whether the plaintiff lacks cause of action? OPD-1\n  (6) Whether the plaintiff is estopped by her words' and conduct? OPD-1\n  (7) Whether the instant suit is vexatious and' frivolous, as such the defendant No.1 is entitled for special cost? OPD-1\n  (8) Relief.\n  3. The parties led their respective oral as well as documentary evidence, whereupon the learned trial Court vide its judgment and decree dated 31-3-2001, dismissed the suit of plaintiffs Mst. Bakhan Mai and Noor Mai, presently respondents. On appeal, this judgment was reversed by the learned Additional District Judge, Kahroor Pacca (Lodhran), vide his judgment, and decree dated 17-7-2004 and the suit of Mst. Bakhan Mai and others was decreed.\n  4. The learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the three ingredients of the gift namely, offer, acceptance and possession having been established on the record, the judgment of the learned lower appellate Court suffers from illegality. It is further submitted that cogent reasons have not been given by the learned lower appellate Court while reversing the well reasoned judgment and decree of the learned trial Court; that the relevant Muhammadan Law has not been applied in the present case and undue advantage has been given to the respondents on the basis of heir being Pardanashin ladies.\n  5. On the other hand, learned counsel of the respondents has supported the impugned judgment.\n  6. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record minutely with their able assistance.\n  7. The moot point involved in the case revolves around the following issues:-\n  (i) Whether the gift is complete through valid offer by the Donor's acceptance by the Donee and the delivery of possession?\n  (ii) Whether the sisters have been defrauded and have been deprived of their due share of inherited by their brother because of the fact their being illiterate villages and Pardanashin ladies?\n  8. My findings on these issues are:\n  (i) The property left by deceased Azeem, the father of the parties, rightly devolved upon them through Mutation No.803 (Exh.P.1) but it appears that the petitioner kept alive his lust to appropriate the property left by his father by fraud. From the evidence of the witnesses of the petitioner, it is not established that the offer of gift was made to the sisters/respondents by the petitioner nor it is established that it was accepted by the respondents/sisters. Even the delivery of possession is highly doubtful. It was the joint property and the petitioner kept the sisters in oblivion about the. correct position and kept them satisfied by paying them nominal income of the usufruct. The exact place, date and time of the gift has also not been given. It is universally accepted that Muslim in this part of the globe, usually hold Qul Khawani after the three days of the death of the deceased. Muhammad Nawaz P.W.7 has stated the Qul Khawani was held after three days, whereas, D. W-6 has stated that the Qul Khawani was held after three months of the death of Azeem. Muhammad Nawaz D.W.7 was not certain whether the Qul Khawani was held after three days or three months of the death of the deceased D.W.8 Manzoor did not mention the place, day, month or time of his Qul Khwani of his father, when the respondents/sisters had gifted the property to Manzoor brother. Such major contradictions negate and nullify the story of Hiba cooked up by the petitioner. Specific evidence of three ingredients of gift i.e. declaration of gift, acceptance of gift and transfer of possession are lacking in the present case. This establishes that the petitioner has cooked up a story of gift by the sisters/ respondents so as to deprive them from the inheritance of their father Azeem.\n  (ii) In the case of gift a very heavy burden lies on the shoulders of the donee to prove beyond any shadow of doubt, the offer, acceptance and the delivery of possession. Such heavy onus was on petitioner, which he failed to discharge. Even the statement of the revenue authorities who entered the mutation in question, is not confidence inspiring. In any case, even in the presence of a mutation of gift in question, the petitioner was under a bounded duty to prove the gift beyond any shadow of doubt, which he has failed to do. Additionally, this fact cannot be lost sight of that the respondents are Pardanashin ladies. It has been held in Aziza Begum v. Mst. Badnshahan and others 1994 MLD 1741 as follows:---\n  ---Gift---Gift deed by a Paradanashin lady---Plea of fraud by alleged donor---Plaintiff (donor) being a Paradashin lady was entitled to protection and even if she had signed the gift deed in question, defendants could not draw any premium on it for their failure to bring on record evidence to the effect that at the crucial time independent advice was available to her---Alleged gift deed was, thus, of no binding effect.\"\n  In Ghulam Ali and 2 others v. Mst.

The bone of contention in between the parties is the alleged gift made by the sisters of their inherited land by way of gift to their brother Manzoor and then reflected in mutation No.805 dated 5-7-1987. Mst. Bakhan Mai and Noor Mai filed a suit against their brother Manzoor and Maryam Mai, Manzoor Mai and Nazir Mai being pro forma defendants stating therein that the none of the sisters of Manzoor had made any gift to their brother Manzoor, and the sisters of Manzoor being Pardanashin ladies were defrauded and gift was fraudulent having been obtained through fraud and the fraud was further perpetuated by reflecting the same in Mutation No.805 dated 15-7-1987 with connivance of the Revenue Authorities.",

      "case_proceddings": "The petitioner/defendant No.1 Manzoor Ahmed filed the written statement controverting the facts of the plaint and further submitted that the suit was filed with ulterior motives to harass him. On the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed: ---\r\n  (1I) Whether the impugned mutation of Gift No.805, dated 15-7-1987 was validly executed in favour of the defendant No.1? OPD-1\r\n  (2) If the above issue is proved in affirmative the impugned mutation of gift was the result of fraud and misrepresentation and collusion?

OPD-1\r\n  (7) Whether the instant suit is vexatious and' frivolous, as such the defendant No.1 is entitled for special cost? OPD-1\r\n  (8) Relief.\r\n  3. The parties led their respective oral as well as documentary evidence, whereupon the learned trial Court vide its judgment and decree dated 31-3-2001, dismissed the suit of plaintiffs Mst. Bakhan Mai and Noor Mai, presently respondents. On appeal, this judgment was reversed by the learned Additional District Judge, Kahroor Pacca (Lodhran), vide his judgment, and decree dated 17-7-2004 and the suit of Mst. Bakhan Mai and others was decreed.\r\n  4. The learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the three ingredients of the gift namely, offer, acceptance and possession having been established on the record, the judgment of the learned lower appellate Court suffers from illegality. It is further submitted that cogent reasons have not been given by the learned lower appellate Court while reversing the well reasoned judgment and decree of the learned trial Court; that the relevant Muhammadan Law has not been applied in the present case and undue advantage has been given to the respondents on the basis of heir being Pardanashin ladies.\r\n  5. On the other hand, learned counsel of the respondents has supported the impugned judgment.\r\n  6. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record minutely with their able assistance.\r\n  7. The moot point involved in the case revolves around the following issues:-\r\n  (i) Whether the gift is complete through valid offer by the Donor's acceptance by the Donee and the delivery of possession?\r\n  (ii) Whether the sisters have been defrauded and have been deprived of their due share of inherited by their brother because of the fact their being illiterate villages and Pardanashin ladies?\r\n  8. My findings on these issues are:\r\n  (i) The property left by deceased Azeem, the father of the parties, rightly devolved upon them through Mutation No.803 (Exh.P.1) but it appears that the petitioner kept alive his lust to appropriate the property left by his father by fraud. From the evidence of the witnesses of the petitioner, it is not established that the offer of gift was made to the sisters/respondents by the petitioner nor it is established that it was accepted by the respondents/sisters. Even the delivery of possession is highly doubtful. It was the joint property and the petitioner kept the sisters in oblivion about the. correct position and kept them satisfied by paying them nominal income of the usufruct. The exact place, date and time of the gift has also not been given. It is universally accepted that Muslim in this part of the globe, usually hold Qul Khawani after the three days of the death of the deceased. Muhammad Nawaz P.W.7 has stated the Qul Khawani was held after three days, whereas, D. W-6 has stated that the Qul Khawani was held after three months of the death of Azeem. Muhammad Nawaz D.W.7 was not certain whether the Qul Khawani was held after three days or three months of the death of the deceased D.W.8 Manzoor did not mention the place, day, month or time of his Qul Khwani of his father, when the respondents/sisters had gifted the property to Manzoor brother. Such major contradictions negate and nullify the story of Hiba cooked up by the petitioner. Specific evidence of three ingredients of gift i.e. declaration of gift, acceptance of gift and transfer of possession are lacking in the present case. This establishes that the petitioner has cooked up a story of gift by the sisters/ respondents so as to deprive them from the inheritance of their father Azeem.\r\n  (ii) In the case of gift a very heavy burden lies on the shoulders of the donee to prove beyond any shadow of doubt, the offer, acceptance and the delivery of possession. Such heavy onus was on petitioner, which he failed to discharge. Even the statement of the revenue authorities who entered the mutation in question, is not confidence inspiring. In any case, even in the presence of a mutation of gift in question, the petitioner was under a bounded duty to prove the gift beyond any shadow of doubt, which he has failed to do. Additionally, this fact cannot be lost sight of that the respondents are Pardanashin ladies. It has been held in Aziza Begum v. Mst. Badnshahan and others 1994 MLD 1741 as follows:---\r\n  ---Gift---Gift deed by a Paradanashin lady---Plea of fraud by alleged donor---Plaintiff (donor) being a Paradashin lady was entitled to protection and even if she had signed the gift deed in question, defendants could not draw any premium on it for their failure to bring on record evidence to the effect that at the crucial time independent advice was available to her---Alleged gift deed was, thus, of no binding effect.\"\r\n  In Ghulam Ali and 2 others v. Mst. Ghulam Sarwar Naqvi PLD 1990 SC 1, it was held by the Honourable apex Court that as a public policy the brothers should not deprive their sisters from their inheritance of their father on different pretexts.

We have heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the record.\n  3. At the outset learned counsel for the petitioners sought permission for additional evidence on the ground that some documents could not be produced during evidence before the Tribunal as those were missing. The petitioners is a Municipal Organization and the plea is not convincing that is favourable record was missing and now after lapse of many years, the same has been traced out for production as additional evidence. Learned counsel for the respondent rightly resisted the prayer on the ground that such a document can be manipulated to fill up lacuna in the petitioners' case and it is not in the interest of justice to provide a party extraordinary latitude to improve his case by filling up lacuna. We, therefore, turn down the request for production of additional evidence.\n  4. We are conscious of the fact that in constitutional jurisdiction vested under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, we cannot sit on the impugned judgment as a Court of appeal as held in the case from Lahore jurisdiction Barkat Ali v.

Further, we are also conscious of the fact that we are not supposed to disturb reasonable findings of fact c arrived at by the trial Court/tribunal on the basis of evidence available on record to substitute our own findings, as held in the case of Syed Mazhar Hussain Shah through L.Rs. v. Member Board of Revenue Lahore and others 2006 SCMR 959(b). We are also mindful that there is marked difference in constitutional and appellate jurisdictions as held in the case from Lahore Jurisdiction in the case of Inshallah Khan and 10 others v. Sirbuland Khan and 3 others 2004 CLC 1689. Therefore, learned counsel for the petitioner was asked to point out any illegality during the proceedings of the Tribunal or in the judgment.\n  5. It was argued that learned Tribunal appointed a Local Commissioner to visit the spot and give report after local investigation The petitioners/defendants raised objections on the report of Commissioner dated 26-3-2003 submitted by Mr. Ghulam Muhammad Sappal Advocate, D.I.

This being on the one hand, it has been very rightly held by the learned Tribunal that the petitioners herein failed to prove the validity of notice by bringing on record cogent evidence to show the actual width of the street and the encroached portion thereof, on the basis of municipal record, failing which, the continuous possession of the respondents would be the solid indicia of their ownership. This is a very strong ground and would prevail obviously, because the petitioners-T.M.A, has staff to check encroachments at their inception and to disapprove the site plans for new constructions on the encroached lands but none of the concerned branches objected at the relevant moments.\n  8.

Market, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Karachi is property of respondents Nos.1 and 2, and petitioner was tenant in that shop. Ejectment application was filed in the month of April 2006 by landlord stating therein that he has no place of business and was mentally shuttered to have his own business and was a running bangles business in Shop No.6. However, business of bangles was not giving him sufficient profit. Therefore, he needed shop in question for personal bona fide use of his son Syed Mubashir Tahir who at the time of filing ejectment application completed his matriculation and wanted to run his business at the shop-in-question. Ejectment application was allowed by Rent Controller vide order dated 1-4-2008. Appeal was filed' and the appellate Court vide its order dated 11-3-2009 maintained order of Rent Controller.\n  2. Learned counsel for petitioner has submitted that he filed application under section 20 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 for summoning of three witnesses. That application was disallowed by the Rent Controller vide order dated 15-8-2007 and' he has been seriously prejudiced on account of disallowing of such application. Learned counsel further submitted that personal need was not established through evidence by the landlord.\n  3. On the other hand learned counsel for respondent No.2 fully supported both concurrent findings of two Courts below and further submitted that in writ jurisdiction High Court is normally most reluctant to disturb concurrent findings of Courts below and even if different view is possible by looking at the evidence High Court would not substitute its view for views of the two Courts below. Learned counsel for petitioner relied upon Muhammad Hafeez and another v. District Judge, Karachi East and another 2008 SCMR 398, Javed Khalique v. Muhammad Irfan 2008 SCMR 28, Abdul Ghani v. Muhammad Bashir and another 2005 ICJ 41, Abde Ali v. Sheikh Hatim Bhaxi 2003 SCMR 730, Muzaffar Aleem v. Iqbal Ahmad 1999 MLD 3178, Adeel Ahmed Sajid v.

On the other hand learned counsel for respondent No.2 relied upon Muhammad Atique v. Muhammad Hanif Khan 1996 SCMR 1260, Murad Ali v. Sultan Aziz and others 1988 CLC 2281, Mrs. Rafiqa Begum through her legal heirs v. Mrs. Mahmooda Wahidina PLD 1987 Karachi 287, Mrs. Shahnoor Fazal v. Ghulam Akbar Mangi 1987 SCMR 2051, E.M.

Sikandar and others PLD 1974 SC 139 and Muhammad Arif v. Mrs. Anwar Jehan 2000 SCMR 1960.\n  5. I have considered submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and have perused case law and the material placed on record.\n  6. First ground taken by the learned counsel for petitioner was that petitioner filed application under section 20 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 for summoning three witnesses and it was disallowed. I have gone through the said application which is accompanied by an affidavit. I have also gone through the order of the trial Court passed on 15-8-2007. In the application only names of witnesses are mentioned and no reasons are stated. In the affidavit, it is stated that persons to be called as witnesses because their names are mentioned in written statement and they shall depose on oath in respect of averments made in written statement. It was claimed in written statement amount of Rs.4,00,000 was paid by petitioner to landlord as security deposit. Learned trial Court in its order observed that present petitioner had not been able to bring on record any cogent ground as to why the said witnesses to whom he wanted to be called are not in touch with him or have not agreed to file their affidavit-in-evidence in the case or any other circumstances showing that said witnesses are beyond the control of petitioner to put them in witness box. It was further observed by the trial Court that there is no reason stated in the application and supporting affidavit to clarify with regard nature of testimony of which witnesses are likely to be called by Court. Learned counsel for petitioner has not urged any ground in this regard even in the memo of petition. Therefore, I do not think any interference is called for with order of Rent Controller on this score.\n  7. On the question of personal need first major hurdle to be crossed by the petitioner is that there are two concurrent findings against him; and secondly he is in this Court in writ jurisdiction where law needs no authority that in writ petition High Court normally does not interfere within concurrent findings of two Courts below except. in rare and exceptional circumstances when there is non-reading or misreading of evidence or when a provision of law has been misapplied or when a principle of law laid down by superior Courts has not been correctly applied with. Concurrent findings on which ejectment has been allowed is personal bona fide need. Landlord in ejectment application stated that he is facing financial problems and wants to expand his sources of income and he required premises for use by his son who has completed his matriculation. He was extensively cross-examined in this aspect. Relevant part of cross-examination is as under:---\n  \"My son who is elder in age who is 18 years old and afterwards my daughter aged about 16 years and then my son who is aged about 9 years. The house wherein presently I am residing is in the name of my wife. My wife is a house wife. My monthly expenditure is about Rs.15,000 per month. I own one house and two shops, has my whole property. Voluntarily says that shop which is in my possession which is the property of my father. It is a fact that I have stated in my rent case that Shop No.6 situated in K.D.A. Market Block-3, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, is my own property. It is a fact that my father has expired. The Shop No.44 situated in the same K.D.A. Market is my property which is in the tenant of the opponent. It is a fact that Shop No.6 wherein I am doing my business is road facing and the shop with the opponent is inside the market. Both the shops are having same measurement within the same area to be 1.1 x 18 feet. It is a fact that since finding excess area in my Shop No.6 I let out one of its inside portion/wall to Girdari Lal on rent. The said Girdari Lal used to pay me Rs.18,000 per month Shop No.6 is having only one shutter. I used to keep the keys of Shop No.6 with me. The said Girdari Lal deposited Rs.2 lacs with me as security deposit. About 6/7 years ago I had lout the portion of wall to Girdari Lal. It is a fact that I am using the wall of Shop No.6 to run my business of bangles. It is incorrect to suggest that my son used to sell the scarfs and Dupatas in the portion of Shop No.6. My son is not doing any business in Shop No.6. My son does not come to help me in my business. It is a fact that I have let out the front space to the Patheridar to be called as stall to the persons for doing business which are two in all. The other person in the market have also let out, therefore I have done so----The demised shop is required for my son who will do the business of children garment.\"\n  8. Perusal of above would show that it has been clearly established;\n  (i) Landlord has son who is 18 years of age.\n  (ii) Landlord needs shop for use of his son.\n(iii) In the memo of petition landlord stated regarding his income and his expenditure but they need not be adverted to because it is for landlord to decide that he needs to expand his sources of income and needed shop for his son who had turned 1-8. No Court can assume to itself right to decide whether a landlord should be allowed to expand his resources of income or not.\n  9. In Muhammad Hafeez's case for personal bona fide need it was held that statement of landlord, if consistent with pleadings, must be given due weight and absence of material facts from pleading would be fatal to cause of land. Learned counsel failed to point out as to which material facts qua a bona fide need had not been pleaded in the present case. In laved Khalique's case it was held that normally landlord must be allowed benefit of use of his premises, unless any circumstance was brought on record indicating his stated requirement to be mala fide. In Abdul Ghani's case it was a leave granting order where Honourable Supreme Court had granted leave to consider whether landlord failed to establish his bona fides.\n  10. In this case landlord has clearly stated that he needed property for his son who had turned 18 and such finding has not been dislodged in evidence and two Courts below have rightly recorded concurrent findings in this regard. Writ petition is, therefore, dismissed. Parties are left to bear their own cost.\n  S.A.K./S-123/K Petition dismissed.",

NAEEM MASOOD, J.--- The brief facts of the case are that Haji Bahawal-ud-Din/respondent No.3 was the Lumberdar of Chak No.65-WB, Tehsil and District Vehari, Haji Bahawal-ud-Din became old and he made an application in 1991 to the Deputy Commissioner/ Collector to abdicate the crown of Lumberdari and handed over to his son Muhammad Abdul Ghafoor/respondent No.2. The Collector accepted this application and appointed respondent No.2 as Lumberdar, on 10-6-1991. Ahmad Ali one of the sons of Haji Bahawal-ud-Din filed an appeal before respondent No.4, Commissioner, Multan Division, iviultan. Haji Bahawal-ud-Din was summoned in the Court on which he stated that he had not tendered the resignation yet, so the appeal was accepted and Haji Bahawal-ud-Din continued to work as Lumberdar. Against the said order dated 4-1-1993, two sons of Haji Bahawal-ud-Din namely Abdul Ghafoor and Ahmed Ali filed two separate appeals, which were accepted on 5-12-1993 and the case was remanded to the Deputy Commissioner and then on 5-9-1994 to the Commissioner Multan Division, Multan to be decided on merits. On remand Ahmed Ali withdrew his appeal on 27-2-1995 and on the basis of compromise in between the family members, Haji Bahawal-ud-Din's son Abdul Ghafoor was appointed as Lumberdar. It was at this stage, that the petitioners challenged the order dated 10-6-1991 passed by the District Collector, Vehari and the order dated 27-2-1995, passed by the Commissioner, Multan Division, Multan before respondent No.1, Member (Judicial-II), Board of Revenue, Punjab. This revision petition was dismissed vide order of respondent No.1 on 24-7-2000. The petitioners have challenged the said order through this writ petition.\n  2. The learned counsel for the petitioners vehemently contends that a novel procedure has been adopted to retain' the Lumberdari in the family and that a legal, transparent and fair procedure has not been adopted as envisaged under the Rules.\n  3. Learned Additional Advocate General, Punjab and learned counsel representing respondent No.2 have supported the impugned order to be legal and valid. Learned counsel for respondent No.2 has relied upon.\n  Muhammad Shafi v. Syed Mushtaq Hussain Shah and others 1994 MLD 1882, Noor Muhammad, Lambardar v. Member (Revenue), Board of Revenue, Punjab, Lahore and others 2003 SCMR 708, Haji Muhammad Ilyas v. Fazal Hussain and others PLD 1979 Lah. 876, Muhammad Yousaf v. Member Board of Revenue and 4 others 1996 SCMR 1581, Muhammad Aslam v. Syed Ahmad Naeem and others PLD 1992 SC 819, Raees Khan and 5 others v. Afridi Khan and 4 others PLD 1989 Pesh. 75, Bashir Ahmad v. Member Board of Revenue, Punjab, Lahore and 2 others. 2007 CLC 354.\n  4. I have considered the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties as well as learned Additional Advocate General, Punjab and have perused the record minutely.\n  5. It is pertinent to mention at the very beginning that all the authoritative law referred by the learned for respondent No.2 is quite distinguishable for the petition in hand.

      "case_facts": "The brief facts of the case are that Haji Bahawal-ud-Din/respondent No.3 was the Lumberdar of Chak No.65-WB, Tehsil and District Vehari, Haji Bahawal-ud-Din became old and he made an application in 1991 to the Deputy Commissioner/ Collector to abdicate the crown of Lumberdari and handed over to his son Muhammad Abdul Ghafoor/respondent No.2. The Collector accepted this application and appointed respondent No.2 as Lumberdar, on 10-6-1991. Ahmad Ali one of the sons of Haji Bahawal-ud-Din filed an appeal before respondent No.4, Commissioner, Multan Division, iviultan. Haji Bahawal-ud-Din was summoned in the Court on which he stated that he had not tendered the resignation yet, so the appeal was accepted and Haji Bahawal-ud-Din continued to work as Lumberdar. Against the said order dated 4-1-1993, two sons of Haji Bahawal-ud-Din namely Abdul Ghafoor and Ahmed Ali filed two separate appeals, which were accepted on 5-12-1993 and the case was remanded to the Deputy Commissioner and then on 5-9-1994 to the Commissioner Multan Division, Multan to be decided on merits. On remand Ahmed Ali withdrew his appeal on 27-2-1995 and on the basis of compromise in between the family members, Haji Bahawal-ud-Din's son Abdul Ghafoor was appointed as Lumberdar. It was at this stage, that the petitioners challenged the order dated 10-6-1991 passed by the District Collector, Vehari and the order dated 27-2-1995, passed by the Commissioner, Multan Division, Multan before respondent No.1, Member (Judicial-II), Board of Revenue, Punjab.

Tenancy commenced in 2004. Landlord filed an ejectment application in May, 2007 alleging default from January, 2007 to filing of the ejectment application as well as on the ground of personal need. Written statement was filed by the tenant. On application under section 16(1) of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979, tentative rent order was passed by the Rent Controller on 22-4-2008 and the tenant was directed to deposit arrears of rent from January to May, 2007 within 30 days. Tenant was further directed to deposit future monthly rent by 10th of each calendar month. It appears that this order was not complied and consequently application under section 16(2) of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 was filed for striking off defence of the tenant and allowing of the Rent Application. On this application the tenant only filed a statement. Report was called from Clerk of the Court regarding deposit of arrears and rent. The report indicated that the tenant deposited Rs.25,000 on 27-5-2008 while period of 30 days expired on 21-5-2008. The learned trial Court observed that the tenant and his counsel failed to give any plausible reason for this delay. Consequently application under section 16(2) Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 was allowed, defence of tenant was struck off and rent application was allowed.\n  2. Being aggrieved by the order of the Rent Controller appeal was filed by the tenant/petitioner which appeal was dismissed by judgment dated 27-4-2009. The Appellate Court observed as under:\n  \"Here in this case the learned trial Court vide order dated 22-4-2008 directed the appellant to deposit arrears of rent from January 2007 to May, 2007 within 30 days, but the respondent has failed to comply with the above directions. The record shows' that the appellant had deposited Rs.25,000 on 27-5-2008 while 30 days period was expired on 21-5-2008, as such he has failed to comply the directions of the trial Court within time and also has failed to give any plausible explanation for delay.\"\n  3. Learned counsel for the petitioner referred to ground `B' and `C' of his Memo. of Appeal in the Appellate Court. The said two grounds are reproduced below:---\n  \"(b) That the honourable Trial Court has fallen into great error by holding that the tentative order was not complied by the appellant. Although Annexure `C' for deposit of rent for the month of May and June clearly shows, that the said rent was deposited on 10th May, 2008 by strictly complying the tentative order, as the monthly rent was to be deposited in the Court in the main rent case on or before 10th of each calendar month. The honourable Trial Court even did not appreciate that the rent of June, 2008, which was due, to be deposited upon 10th of June, 2008 was also deposited on 10th May, 2008 along with the rent of May, 2008 even one month earlier.\n  (c) That although 30 days for deposit of arrears of rent for disputed period were fixed but the appellant due to not available in Karachi, as he was gone for Tableegh-e-Islam for forty days and returned back on 25/26 May, 2008, therefore after reaching back he immediately deposited the arrears of rent in the Court without any further delay which reflects his bona fide intention to deposit the arrears rent and there was absolutely no mala fide intention on the part of appellant to withhold the arrears of rent. The respondent has already withdrawn the monthly rent along with arrears of rent from the Court with no objection of the appellant, therefore the respondent has not sustained any loss at all due to delay of only 4/5 days but the honourable Trial Court did not appreciate this aspect of the case while passing the impugned order and has penalized the appellant by strictly construing the tentative order only to the extent of arrears of the rent. \"\n  4. Learned counsel relied upon 1990 SCMR 750, 1987 CLC 1391, 1999 MLD 2886 and 2000 CLC 1134.\n  5. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that tentative rent order was passed on 22-4-2008 and therefore period of 30 days for depositing arrears of rent ended on 21-5-2008, rent was deposited on 27-5-2008 and therefore, it was six days beyond last date for payment of rent and no plausible explanation whatsoever has been furnished by the respondent. No counter-affidavit was filed to application under section 16(2) of SRPO. It was contumacious default. There are concurrent findings of two Courts below and in writ jurisdiction this High Court should be most reluctant to disturb concurrent findings.\n  6. While exercising his right of reply the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, though tentative rent order was passed on 22-4-2008 but he came to know of this order on 25/26 May, 2008 and thereafter he promptly compiled with.\n  7. I have considered such submissions made by the learned counsel and have gone through the record. Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon Mst. Fatim-un-Nisa and others v. Mrs. Zubaida, 1990 SCMR 750. In this case Rent Controller had ordered on 28-10-1981 (to deposit arrears of rent by 10-11-1981 and it was pleaded that tenant was not aware of order dated 28-10-1981 as he failed to attend the Court due to illness. Medical Certificate was produced by the tenant.) Delay was condoned and Supreme Court did not interfere. In Jamil Ahmad v. Mrs. Sultan Jehan Begum, 1987 CLC 1391, defence was struck off for three days' delay in depositing rent for one month and eviction was ordered. It was found that tenant was depositing rent regularly in time for last six years. Delay of three days in the circumstances was condoned. In Jawaid Ashraf Khan v. Mst. Suriya Begum, 1999 MLD 2886, tenant had already deposited rent in miscellaneous application with Nazir of the same Court in the name of same landlady and the Rent Controller. Default was held to be not contumacious on the part of the tenant. Order of Rent Controller was set aside and case was remanded by the High Court to the Rent Controller. In Babar Pervez v. Muhammad Saad, 2000 CLC 1134, the amount was deposited by mistake in miscellaneous case instead of the case relating to ejectment application. High Court held that non-compliance in the circumstances could at best be treated as an irregularity and could not .therefore attract penal consequences of section 16(2) of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979.\n  8. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent relied upon Muhammad Yousaf v. Muhammad Bashir and others, 1990 SCMR 557. There was only one day's delay in deposit of monthly rent. Delay was not condoned by the High Court and the Supreme Court did not interfere. In Messrs. Platinum Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Messrs State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan, 1991 MLD 1256 it was held that Rent Controller did not have discretion to condone delay and Muhammad Yousaf's case was followed. G.Z. Malik v. Mrs. Khayyam Baig, PLD 1991 Karachi 370 is a judgment by the same Judge who authored Platinum Insurance Company's case and is practically in the same terms. In Messrs Pragma Leather Industries v. Mrs. Sadia Sajjad, PLD 1996 SC 724, it was held that in constitutional jurisdiction the High Court would be justified in not interfering with such findings.\n  9. In the present case, delay is for six days: the amount was deposited on 27-5-2008 instead of on 21-5-2008. No counter-affidavit to application under section 16(2) of SRPO, 1979 was filed in the Court of the Rent Controller. However, on grounds of appeal as quoted above, it was stated that the tenant was not available at Karachi as he had gone for Tableegh-e-Islam for forty days and returned back on 25/26th May. In the first ground tenant had stated that since he had paid rent by 10th for the month of May there could not have any reason why he could not pay arrears. There is no assertion here as to how tenant came to know about requirement of deposit of rent on May, 10th. It was by order dated 22-4-2006 that required him to deposit rent on 10th May. It was in the same order dated 22-4-2008 that the learned Rent Controller had ordered to deposit of arrears and then payment of monthly rent by 10 of each month. Since the tenant deposited rent on 10th of May, the things speak for itself; at least on 10th of May he knew of the tentative rent order. The case-law referred to by the learned counsel does not really help him because in Zubaida's case the tenant pleaded that he did not know of the rent order. But here the tenant compiled with one part of the rent order and did not comply with the other part of the same order. The other three cases relied upon by the petitioner are the cases where there was a technical default either rent deposited in the wrong case but in the same Court or by mistake in another case or in Jamil Ahmad's case consistent conduct over six years. No such element is present in this case. The strict view taken by the Supreme Court in Muhammad Yousaf's case is law of the land. Even otherwise the petitioner has failed to make out any ground for interference with concurrent orders by the Court below. This Constitution Petition is therefore, dismissed in limine with listed application.\n  S.A.K./M-200/K Petition dismissed.",

The respondent has already withdrawn the monthly rent along with arrears of rent from the Court with no objection of the appellant, therefore the respondent has not sustained any loss at all due to delay of only 4/5 days but the honourable Trial Court did not appreciate this aspect of the case while passing the impugned order and has penalized the appellant by strictly construing the tentative order only to the extent of arrears of the rent. \"\n  4. Learned counsel relied upon 1990 SCMR 750, 1987 CLC 1391, 1999 MLD 2886 and 2000 CLC 1134.\n  5. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that tentative rent order was passed on 22-4-2008 and therefore period of 30 days for depositing arrears of rent ended on 21-5-2008, rent was deposited on 27-5-2008 and therefore, it was six days beyond last date for payment of rent and no plausible explanation whatsoever has been furnished by the respondent. No counter-affidavit was filed to application under section 16(2) of SRPO. It was contumacious default. There are concurrent findings of two Courts below and in writ jurisdiction this High Court should be most reluctant to disturb concurrent findings.\n  6. While exercising his right of reply the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, though tentative rent order was passed on 22-4-2008 but he came to know of this order on 25/26 May, 2008 and thereafter he promptly compiled with.\n  7. I have considered such submissions made by the learned counsel and have gone through the record. Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon Mst. Fatim-un-Nisa and others v. Mrs. Zubaida, 1990 SCMR 750. In this case Rent Controller had ordered on 28-10-1981 (to deposit arrears of rent by 10-11-1981 and it was pleaded that tenant was not aware of order dated 28-10-1981 as he failed to attend the Court due to illness. Medical Certificate was produced by the tenant.) Delay was condoned and Supreme Court did not interfere. In Jamil Ahmad v. Mrs. Sultan Jehan Begum, 1987 CLC 1391, defence was struck off for three days' delay in depositing rent for one month and eviction was ordered. It was found that tenant was depositing rent regularly in time for last six years. Delay of three days in the circumstances was condoned. In Jawaid Ashraf Khan v. Mst. Suriya Begum, 1999 MLD 2886, tenant had already deposited rent in miscellaneous application with Nazir of the same Court in the name of same landlady and the Rent Controller. Default was held to be not contumacious on the part of the tenant. Order of Rent Controller was set aside and case was remanded by the High Court to the Rent Controller. In Babar Pervez v. Muhammad Saad, 2000 CLC 1134, the amount was deposited by mistake in miscellaneous case instead of the case relating to ejectment application. High Court held that non-compliance in the circumstances could at best be treated as an irregularity and could not .therefore attract penal consequences of section 16(2) of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979.\n  8. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent relied upon Muhammad Yousaf v. Muhammad Bashir and others, 1990 SCMR 557. There was only one day's delay in deposit of monthly rent. Delay was not condoned by the High Court and the Supreme Court did not interfere. In Messrs. Platinum Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Messrs State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan, 1991 MLD 1256 it was held that Rent Controller did not have discretion to condone delay and Muhammad Yousaf's case was followed. G.Z. Malik v. Mrs. Khayyam Baig, PLD 1991 Karachi 370 is a judgment by the same Judge who authored Platinum Insurance Company's case and is practically in the same terms. In Messrs Pragma Leather Industries v. Mrs. Sadia Sajjad, PLD 1996 SC 724, it was held that in constitutional jurisdiction the High Court would be justified in not interfering with such findings.",

NAEEM MASOOD, J.--- This civil revision is directed against the judgment and decree dated 9-2-2007 passed by learned Additional District Judge, Rajanpur; whereby the judgment and decree dated 16-6-2006 passed by learned Civil Judge, 1st Class, Rajanpur was set aside and the suit filed by the petitioners/plaintiff was dismissed.\n  2. The facts in brief are that the petitioners/plaintiffs filed a suit for possession about the property in dispute pleading therein that one Allah Bakhsh was the owner of the property in dispute and that Muhammad Bakhsh son of Allah Rakha purchased the said property on 31-10-1945 and that Allah Rakha the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners has expired and the petitioners being his legal heirs are owners of the suit property. That the property in dispute was taken as a temporary residence so as to return the same on demand and that the petitioners had made persistent demands but the respondents did not vacate. The suit was contested by the respondents. After the trial, the suit was decreed on 31-7-2003 in favour of the petitioners against which an appeal was filed and the case was remanded by the learned appellate Court for framing additional issues to the following effect:---\n  (i) Whether description of the suit property is incorrect, if so, what is the correct description of the property and its effect? OPD.\n  (ii) Whether the suit of the plaintiff is not maintainable? OPD.\n  3. Both the parties produced their respective evidence in connection with the afore-said additional issues also and after recording evidence of the parties on the additional issues, the learned trial Court again decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff vide its judgment and decree dated 15-6-2006. The respondents filed an appeal, which was accepted by the learned Additional District Judge Rajanpur vide the impugned judgment dated 9-2-2007.\n  4. The learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the evidence of P.W. P.W.2 and P.W.3 has supported the version of the petitioners.\n  5. Conversely ' the learned counsel for the respondents has submitted that D.W.1 has given a clear picture of the heritage and has deposed that the petitioners are sons of Allah Rakha. The name of father of Allah Rakha was Sumar and his father's name was Ghulam Rasool and name of their grandfather was Pehlwan. Pehlwan and Sumar were real brothers. Sumar was sole son of Allah Rakha, while there were two sons of Pehiwan and they were having half share each in the suit property and that the petitioners and respondents are in possession of the property according to their respective shares. It is further contended from the evidence of the D.W.1 that 25 years ago, the petitioners shifted to Kashmore and their share is still lying at the spot and some of the said property had been sold out. He further contended that D.W.2 Allah Ditta had deposed that the legal heirs of Pehiwan are residing in the disputed house according to their respective shares and share of the petitioners is still lying vacant at the spot. D. W.3 Gul Muhammad also supported the evidence of the other D.Ws.\n  Apart from the oral evidence 'a registered sale-deed of the year 1932 has been placed on the file and the learned counsel contends that according to the contents of the afore-said registered document, Sumar predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners/plaintiffs had sold out half share of the suit property to one Muhammad Bakhsh- son of Mian Allah Wasaya. But a separate note is given on the backside of the last page of registered sale-deed that the property, which was purchased by afore-said Muhammad Bakhsh from Allah Rakha, had been re-sold to Allah Rakha.\n  6. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have seen the record minutely.\n  7. The oral as well as documentary evidence of the petitioners/ plaintiffs has given two versions. On one side they have asserted that they are sole owners of property of Allah Rakha, and successors-in interest of Pehlwan have no concern with the same. On the other side, their version is that according to note dated 31-10-1944, the property which was sold by them, has been returned to them by the transferee Muhammad Bakhsh to whom they had already sold by way of registered sale-deed. Both these versions, apart from being divergent, appear to be unbelievable. The petitioners have failed to prove ownership of Allah Rakha, their predecessor-in-interest. The only thing proved is a sale by Sumar son of Allah Rakha by way of afore-said registered sale-deed. Similarly, a shadow of doubt is cast upon the note dated 31-10-1944.\n  This note has' not been proved in accordance with law. Muhammad Bakhsh purchaser of the property who is alleged to have re-sold the same to the petitioners through afore-said note, has not been produced in the witness box. The evidence of Muhammad Bakhsh is the best evidence in this regard. The best evidence having not been produced, the contention of the petitioners with regard to the ownership of the property in dispute gets shattered. It has been laid down by Honourable apex Court of Pakistan, as well as of India, that best evidence must be produced in the case and should not be withheld. Some of the decisions are as follows: ---\n  (i) Sardar v. Gurdial AIR 1927 PC 230\n  It was held by the Honourable Privy Counsel that the testimony of the parties of knowing something must be in the Court as evidence on oath and not otherwise.\n  (ii) Bajranglal v. Sheeta Ram AIR 1949 Cal. 457\n  Relying on AIR 1928 PC 39 it has been held that the parties failing to call as his witness the principal person involved in transaction who is in position to give first hand account of matter in controversy and throw light on them and who can refuse allegations of other side is fatal to the case. It is legitimate to draw adverse influence against such party.\n  (iii) Ramchand v. India AIR 1962 Bombay 92\n  Held---failure to produce the best evidence presumption is against such party.\n  (iv) Virendra v. Jagjivan AIR 1974 SC 1957 Held---non-production of material witness is fatal to the case.\n  (v) Bhagwan v. Bhishan AIR 1974 Punjab 7\n  Held---material witness not appearing in Court. It is fatal to the case.\n  (vi) Mst. Kamina v. Al-Amin 1992 SCMR 1715\n  Held---that the facts within special knowledge of person must be established by him personally.\n  (vii) Iswar v. Harihar AIR 199(sic) SC 1341\n  Held---best evidence to be produced. Otherwise an adverse influence shall be drawn.\n  8. In a suit for possession under section 8 of the Specific Relief Act, on basis of the title like the present case, the plaintiff is under bounden duty to establish his ownership without any shadow of doubt.\n  No exception can be made to the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned lower appellate Court. It has been held by this Court and the Honourable apex Court that the burden of proof on a party is to be discharged unclinchingly and not with shaky evidence.\n  Besides, the learned counsel of the petitioners has failed to bring the case under the parameters of revisional jurisdiction. No jurisdictional error or illegality in the impugned judgment has been shown. It is noteworthy to mention that the parameters of the revisional jurisdiction are well defined in NS Vehkatagiri Ayyangar's case PLD 1949 PC 26 as follows:---\n  \"This section empowers the High Court to satisfy itself upon three matters; (1) that the order of the subordinate Court is within its jurisdiction; (2) that the case is one in which the Court ought to exercise jurisdiction; and (3) that in exercising jurisdiction, the Court has not acted illegally, that is, in breach of some provision of law, or with material irregularity, that is, by committing some error of procedure in the course of the trial which is material in that it may 'have affected the ultimate decision. If the High Court is satisfied upon those three matters, it has no power to interfere because it differs, however, profoundly, from the conclusion of the subordinate Court upon questions of fact or law.\"\n  The same views has been reiterated in Abdul Ghafoor v. Kallu 2008 SCMR 452, wherein it has been held that non-reading and misreading of the material evidence can only be agitated in the revision petition under section 115, C.P.C.\n  9.

Facts have been stated in the order dated 21-5-2009 passed by this Court. It is quoted below:--\n  \"Learned counsel for the appellants contends that the appellant was inducted as tenant in the premises by the respondent at the monthly rent of Rs.2,000, which was being paid regularly by the appellant. It is further contended that subsequently enhancement of the rent was demanded by the respondent from Rs.2,000 to Rs.4,000 and since the enhanced amount was not paid, the appellant was threatened to be evicted from the premises. As such the appellant filed a Civil Suit for appropriate relief in which the application under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. filed by the respondent was dismissed. The respondent filed appeal which was allowed and the plaint was rejected. It is further stated by the learned counsel for the appellant that before the Civil Forum the respondent took a plea that the remedy before the Civil Court is not available to the appellant and instead the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963 would apply. The appellant thereafter filed proceedings before the Additional Controller of Rent Karachi Cantonment, which were dismissed on 18-2-2009, on the ground that since the appellant is tenant in the property which comes under the provisions of section 3 of the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963, therefore, the said forum has no jurisdiction in the matter. The appellant has impugned the said order in this First Rent Appeal in support of his contention, he has relied upon the case reported in PLD 1987 SC 107, in which it has been held that a party cannot at the same time blow hot and cold. Where a party persuaded a Tribunal to adopt a particular course for determining the issue in question and accepted benefit of such arrangement, he cannot be allowed to repudiate when it comes to liability and obligation therein.\n  On the other hand, the learned counsel' for respondent has relied upon the case reported in PLD 1966 SC 1, 1987 CLC 591 and 2002 YLR 1268. He contended that no remedy was available to the appellant and the Act is not applicable in respect of the properties owned by the Central Government and admittedly the property in question is owned by the respondent, who is a Federal functionary.\n  The first case referred to by the learned counsel for the respondent pertains to the controversy of different ownership of land and building. The second easels in respect of KPT property and the third case is in respect of lessee of Cantonment Board.\n  It is an admitted 'position that the property in question was handed over to the Appellant on tenancy basis by the respondent but an attempt is being made to evict him from the property without due process of law and the respondent took a plea before the Civil Court that Civil Court does not have jurisdiction in the matter and when the matter is agitated before the Rent Controller a plea was taken that such legislation was also not available to them for any relief in view of the bar contained in section 3 of the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963. No party can be left without any remedy and any person letting property cannot be evicted therefrom without due process of law as the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan guarantees not only rights of people in respect of properties but also for their livelihood and the facts and circumstances of this case are such which warrant interference of this Court, particularly in view of principles laid down in Waris Meah's case, reported as PLD 1957 SC (Pak) 157.\n  It is also to be noted that section 17 of Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963 provides procedure of ejectment through the process of law, whereas section 3 gives an amenity to the Federal Government from the same law, which apparently is discriminatory. When a property was given to the tenant, in such a manner the respondent assumed the role of landlord in the matter and cannot be allowed to take undue advantage only because such functionary is a Federal Government functionary.\n  In view of the above circumstances, I convert this First Rent Appeal into Constitutional Petition and direct the appellant to implead the Ministry of Defence as a party in the matter and file amended title.\"\n  Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that petitioners are tenants in four separate shops in question for more than ten years and they were paying rent at the rate of Rs.2,000 per month. Without any justification, without any due process and without any rhyme or reason, in 2005 rent was increased by respondent No.1 from Rs.2,000 per month to Rs.4,000 per month. Against such increase when the tenant filed civil suit, application under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. was filed. Although the trial Court dismissed the applications, the Appellate Court rejected the plaint holding that dispute pertains to rent matter and therefore jurisdiction is with the Rent Controller under the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963. When the petitioners approached the Rent Controller, relying upon section 3 of the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963, their applications were dismissed. He submitted that the respondents had been blowing hot and cold in the same breath: before the Civil Court, it had been stated that Rent Controller had the jurisdiction and before Rent Controller it was pleaded that he did not have jurisdiction. Learned counsel referred to section 17(11) of the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963, to contend that even if the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963 is not applicable by virtue of section 3 thereof, the provisions of section 17(11) have the overriding effect over the provisions of section 3, and it was available to the respondents to seek eviction of the tenant in the event of non-payment of rent within the period prescribed or for infringement of any of the term of possession or occupation. Learned counsel submitted that no such procedure was adopted.\n  Learned counsel for respondent No.1 admitted that shops were given on rent about ten years ago. He also admitted that rent was increased from Rs.2,000 per month to Rs.4,000 and notice in this regard was given on 7-11-2005. Learned counsel relied upon Messrs East-West Insurance Company Ltd., through Chairman and others v. Messrs Muhammad Shafi & Company through Managing Partner and 2 others, ' 2009 CLD 960, to say that where the Tribunal or Court does not have jurisdiction under law same cannot be conferred on Court or Tribunal by consent or even by Court and Courts are bound to decide lis before them in accordance with law. Learned counsel for respondent No.2 adopted arguments of learned counsel for respondent No.1.\n  I have considered the submissions of the learned counsel. When the matter was taken in civil suit before the Civil Court the following prayer was made:---\n  \"(a). To declare that the notice dated 16-11-2005 issued from the office of the defendant in the name of the plaintiff is mala fide against the law and 100% enhancement in rent, by one stroke of pen is illegal.\n  (b). To grant injunction and restrain the defendant, his representative or representatives, employees, attorney(s), agent or agents, person or persons who acting on behalf of the defendant not to dispossess the plaintiff from, his Shop No.13 illegally/forcibly without due process of law.\"\n  During pendency of the suit application under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. 'was moved on behalf of the present respondent No.1 for rejection of the plaint on the ground that remedy allegedly claimed by the plaintiff is available under a special law on enhancement of rent of the suit property and bar existed in the way of Civil Litigation under Central Government Land and Buildings (Recovery of Possession) Ordinance, 1965. Learned Appellate Court referred to section 10 of the Ordinance of 1965 and also to sections 3, 4 and 5 of that Ordinance and rejected this grounds under the provisions of Ordinance 1965. However, it accepted the ground under the provisions of Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963 and observed that the tenants had alternate remedy under the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963 and therefore suit was held as barred under that law.\n  Learned Appellate Court did not take into consideration provisions of section 3 of Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963. The said section 3 is in the following words:---\n  \"S. 3. Act not to apply to certain buildings.--- Nothing contained in this Act shall apply to---\n  (a) any evacuee property as defined in the Pakistan (Administration of Evacuee Property) Act, 1957 (XII of 1957); and\n  (b) any property owned by the Central Government, any Provincial Government, Railways, Port Trust or Cantonment Board and property owned, managed or controlled by any other local authority under the administrative control of the Central Government or of any Provincial Government.\"\n  Therefore, since the property in question' is owned by the Government of Pakistan and the Act of 1963 is not applicable to the premises in question, the tenants could not avail any remedy under that Act. However, as far as the respondents are concerned, they could not have lost sight of subsection (11) of section 17, which is in the following words:---\n  \"(11) Notwithstanding any thing contained in this Act or elsewhere, the Central Government or the Provincial Government, a Railway, a Port Trust, a Cantonment Board or any other local authority may also apply to the Controller to seek eviction of the tenant from its building whether owned, hired or requisitioned, in the event of non-payment of rent within the period hereinbefore prescribed or for infringement of any of the terms of possession or occupation.\"\n  A reading of the above two provision i.e. section 3 and subsection (11) of section 17, clearly indicates the position in law to be that except to the extent of subsection (11) of section 17, the provisions of the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963 are not applicable to a building or premises owned by the Federal Government or other authorities named in section 3 of Act of 1963. The tenant of such building could not have recourse to any proceeding under the Act of 1963. However, that does not mean that the authority which owned has an unfettered licence. If it seeks eviction on ground of non-payment of rent of for infringement of any of the terms of possession or occupation, it has to move the concerned Rent Controller under subsection (11) of section 17. Without resorting to such procedure eviction of tenant on ground of default would be without lawful authority and of no legal effect. Under Ordinance of 1965, section 10 bars jurisdiction of Civil Court from passing an order in any suit or proceeding granting. temporary or interim injunction restraining Central Government or any officer authorized by it from taking possession of any land or building under that Ordinance. All that is barred under that 'section is a Temporary Injunction or interim injunction. A perpetual injunction or declaration is certainly not barred. As I have quoted above, the suit filed by the present petitioner was for Declaration and thereafter injunction and both these were not barred. The observation of the Appellate Court below that he had remedy under the Rent Restriction Act, 1963 was therefore, misconceived. No such remedy is available to the tenant/petitioner.\n  Moment petitioner's application was dismissed by the Rent Controller on 18 November, 2009 the petitioners were forcibly evicted from their shops. This was done without following procedure prescribed under subsection (11) of section 17 of Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963. Petitioner might have been, in our opinion, wrong in approaching the Rent Controller because Rent Controller did not have the jurisdiction and therefore, rightly dismissed the' applications filed by the petitioners.; However, dismissal of that application did not give licence to the respondent to dispossess petitioners and take over the premises. If the respondents feel that petitioners have committed default in payment of rent or has violated any other condition or occupation they were at liberty to move concerned Rent Controller and obtain an order of eviction. On the other hand if they needed the building for their own bona fide use they should have availed due process of law. This was not done. Consequently these writ petitions are accepted. The respondents are directed to put the petitioners in occupation of their respective shops within 30 days of the date of this order. However, if respondents feel that petitioners have committed default in payment of rent or have violated or infringed any of the terms of possession or occupation the respondents are at liberty to move the concerned Rent Controller under subsection (11) of section 17 and if the respondents feel they did need premises for their bona fide purpose they may do so after following process in accordance with law. On the other hand if respondents feel that monthly rent needs to be enhanced, they may serve notice on the petitioner and thereafter pass a speaking order.\n  M. H./Z-28/K Petition allowed.",

      "case_facts": "\"Learned counsel for the appellants contends that the appellant was inducted as tenant in the premises by the respondent at the monthly rent of Rs.2,000, which was being paid regularly by the appellant. It is further contended that subsequently enhancement of the rent was demanded by the respondent from Rs.2,000 to Rs.4,000 and since the enhanced amount was not paid, the appellant was threatened to be evicted from the premises. As such the appellant filed a Civil Suit for appropriate relief in which the application under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. filed by the respondent was dismissed. The respondent filed appeal which was allowed and the plaint was rejected. It is further stated by the learned counsel for the appellant that before the Civil Forum the respondent took a plea that the remedy before the Civil Court is not available to the appellant and instead the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963 would apply. The appellant thereafter filed proceedings before the Additional Controller of Rent Karachi Cantonment, which were dismissed on 18-2-2009, on the ground that since the appellant is tenant in the property which comes under the provisions of section 3 of the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963, therefore, the said forum has no jurisdiction in the matter.

NAEEM MASOOD, J.--- This petition has been filed with the following prayer:---\n  \"To accept the petition and set aside the judgment and decrees of both the Courts below.\"\n  In the pro forma the original suit is mentioned to have been instituted on 8-5-1978 and decided on 28-9-1987. Whereas, the first appeal has been mentioned to have been filed on 30-4-1990 and decided on 23-12-1990.\n  2. The brief facts of the case are that a civil suit for declaration was filed by Jan Muhammad, Mst. Fatto and Abdul Ghani plaintiffs against Muhammad Shafi, Ramzan, Ghulam and Saleh. File contains the written statement filed only by Muhammad Shafi.\n  3. The parties led their respective evidence and vide order dated 28-9-1987, ex parte proceedings were taken against the defendants and the suit was decreed in favour of the plaintiff.\n  4. Muhammad Shafi defendant/respondent No.8 filed an application dated nil before the learned trial Court for setting aside the order dated 28-9-1987 passed by the learned trial Court. The court-fee, however, as available on application at page 65 is dated 18-4-1983. This application was dismissed vide order dated 24-2-1990.\n  5. Against the order dated 24-2-1990, an appeal was filed by Muhammad Shafi respondent with a prayer to set aside the ex parte order/decree dated 28-9-1987. This appeal was dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge, Khanewal vide order dated 23-12-1990. Muhammad Shafi respondent No.8 does not appear to have pursued the matter further. From file of the petitioner it, however, appears that an application. under section 12(2), C.P.C. was filed before learned Additional District Judge, Khanewal by Muhammad Saleh petitioner with a prayer to set aside the order dated 28-9-1987 and dated 23-12-1990. The learned Additional District Judge dismissed the said application under section 12(2), C.P.C. before him observing that the said Court was not seized of the matter which culminated in the decree dated 28-9-1987, wherein the ex parte decree was obtained and that the said Court had merely disposed of the appeal against the order dated 24-2-1990 vide its order dated 23-12-1990.\n  6. The learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the petitioner had filed an application under section 12(2), C.P.C. which merited to be accepted by the learned Additional District, Judge. It is also submitted that the petitioner was bona fide purchaser of share of the respondents and was therefore, impleaded as party in the suit and was entitled to be heard. It is further contended that the decree dated 28-9-1987 was passed without recording any evidence. It was further contended that the plaint was liable to be 'rejected under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C.\n  7. Conversely, die learned counsel for the respondents has vehemently controverted the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner and has supported the impugned orders. He has further contended that the whole proceedings have been taken in confusion.\n  8. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record.\n  98. It is pertinent to notice that the petitioner has not challenged the ex parte order dated 24-2-1990. The ex parte order passed against the defendants was challenged only by Muhammad Shafi, respondent No.8. After the dismissal of the application for setting aside the ex parte order it was only Muhammad Shafi respondent No.8 who has filed an appeal against the order dated 24-2-1990. Hence onward Muhammad Shafi, respondent No.8 does not appear to have chosen to file a revision petition.\n  10. So for as the petitioner is concerned, he had not challenged the ex parte order. However, he chose to file an application under section 12(2), C.P.C. for setting aside the ex parte order/decree dated 28-9-1987 passed by learned trial Court, as also the order dated 23-12-1990 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Khanewal. The original decree was passed on 28-9-1987. The application to set aside the said decree was filed on 2-10-1991. The same was thus barred by time.\n  11. Besides the learned Additional District Judge correctly observed in his judgment dated 22-4-1993 that as the decree dated 28-9-1987 was passed by the learned trial Court and not by the learned Additional District Judge, therefore, the application under section 12(2), C.P.C. was not filed before the learned trial Court who had passed the decree dated 28-9-1987. The learned appellate Court had nothing to do with any fraud or collusion committed before the learned trial Court. Such issue merited to be raised before the learned trial Court. In this respect, better it is to borrow wisdom from the law laid down by this Court and the honourable apex Court. It has been held in PLD 1995 SC 564 in case titled as \"Mubarak Ali v. Fazal Muhammad\" as under:---\n  \"What is intended by section 12(2) C.P.C. is that a party must go to Court, which has finally decided the matter, if it desires to secure a reversal judgment, decree or order on the ground of fraud, misrepresentation or want of jurisdiction.\"\n  Likewise dictum laid down in 1979 YLR 2681 titled Mst. Riaz Fatima v. Ch. Ijaz Ahmad relying upon PLD 1995 SC 564 is as follows:---\n  \"Amending Ordinance X of 1980 took note of the aforesaid situation and enacted that where a person challenged the validity of judgment and decree or order on the plea of fraud, misrepresentation or want of jurisdiction, such person shall approach the same Court and filing of separate suit was prohibited. Underlying purpose of this legislation was to weed out/curb the flow of false and vexatious suit on the plea misrepresentation, fraud/want of jurisdiction and such person was required to approach the Court, which passed such final judgment, decree or order. The next issue which arises is what is/was the final Court which passed/passes final judgment, decree or order. This provision clearly says that application has to be removed to the Court which passed/passes the final judgment, decree or order. The expression \"final Court\" came up for correction of Mubarik Ali Fazal Muhammad and another PLD 1995 SC 564. Speaking for the Bench, His lordship\n  Mr. Justice Rustam S. Sidhwa said:\n  \"What is intended is that a party must go to that Court which has finally decided the matter, if it desires to secure a reversal of its judgment, decree or order on the ground of fraud, misrepresentation or want of jurisdiction. The word \"final\" can mean that the last in a series of judgments, decree or orders which may have been passed.\"\n  In 1999 YLR 2720 titled Muhammad Yousaf v. Noor Din it was held:---\n  \"(ii) The word \"Final\" means in the series of judgment, decree or order which is no longer alterable by the Court passing the said judgment, decree or order. The question as to which is that Court, shall depend upon the facts and circumstances of the case. For example, if the Supreme Court dismisses leave to appeal on mere technical ground and without touching the merits of the case, it will not be a final judgment but if leave is refused and the Court renders the decision on merits after assessing the merits and demerits of the case, then that judgment of apex Court, on the basis of doctrine of merger, will be final judgment. This rule also applies to this Court and subordinate Court.\"\n  In 1999 SCMR 1555 titled Province of Punjab v. Muhammad Irshad, it was held;---\n  \"The question at issue is as to whether above application was competent under subsection (2) of section 12 of the C.P.C. in respect of the above order of refusing leave. Subsection (2) of section 12 of the C.P.C. provides that when a person challenges the validity of a judgment, decree or order on the plea of fraud, misrepresentation or want of jurisdiction, he shall seek his remedy by making an application to the Court which passed the final judgment, decree or order and not by a separate suit.\"\n  Similarly in PLD 1991 SC 197 titled Government of Sindh v. Ch. Fazal Muhammad the dictum laid down was:---\n  \"The first question for consideration is that what is the scope of section 12(2), C.P.C. before we proceed to examine the question.\n  Section 12(2)\n  \"Where a person challenges the validity of a judgment, decree or order on the plea of fraud, misrepresentation or want of jurisdiction, he shall seek his remedy by making an application to the Court which passed the final judgment, decree or order and not by a separate suit.\"\n  A perusal of the above provision would show that the petitioner could challenge the validity of (i) judgment, (ii) decree (iii) or order on the plea of (a) fraud (b) misrepresentation and (c) want of jurisdiction by application to the Court which passed the final judgment, decree or order.\"\n  The Ratio Decidendi in 1993 SCMR 1171 titled Secretary Ministry of Religious Affairs and Minorities v.

As held in the Government of Sindh and another v. Ch. Fazal Muhammad PLD 1991 SC 197, such application can be filed in the Court which passed the final order. The final order in the present case was passed by the High Court and, therefore, the application filed by the appellants there was competent.\"\n  12.

The court-fee, however, as available on application at page 65 is dated 18-4-1983. This application was dismissed vide order dated 24-2-1990.\n  5. Against the order dated 24-2-1990, an appeal was filed by Muhammad Shafi respondent with a prayer to set aside the ex parte order/decree dated 28-9-1987. This appeal was dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge, Khanewal vide order dated 23-12-1990. Muhammad Shafi respondent No.8 does not appear to have pursued the matter further. From file of the petitioner it, however, appears that an application. under section 12(2), C.P.C. was filed before learned Additional District Judge, Khanewal by Muhammad Saleh petitioner with a prayer to set aside the order dated 28-9-1987 and dated 23-12-1990. The learned Additional District Judge dismissed the said application under section 12(2), C.P.C. before him observing that the said Court was not seized of the matter which culminated in the decree dated 28-9-1987, wherein the ex parte decree was obtained and that the said Court had merely disposed of the appeal against the order dated 24-2-1990 vide its order dated 23-12-1990.\n  6. The learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the petitioner had filed an application under section 12(2), C.P.C. which merited to be accepted by the learned Additional District, Judge. It is also submitted that the petitioner was bona fide purchaser of share of the respondents and was therefore, impleaded as party in the suit and was entitled to be heard. It is further contended that the decree dated 28-9-1987 was passed without recording any evidence. It was further contended that the plaint was liable to be 'rejected under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C.\n  7. Conversely, die learned counsel for the respondents has vehemently controverted the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner and has supported the impugned orders. He has further contended that the whole proceedings have been taken in confusion.\n  8. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record.\n  98. It is pertinent to notice that the petitioner has not challenged the ex parte order dated 24-2-1990. The ex parte order passed against the defendants was challenged only by Muhammad Shafi, respondent No.8. After the dismissal of the application for setting aside the ex parte order it was only Muhammad Shafi respondent No.8 who has filed an appeal against the order dated 24-2-1990. Hence onward Muhammad Shafi, respondent No.8 does not appear to have chosen to file a revision petition.\n  10. So for as the petitioner is concerned, he had not challenged the ex parte order. However, he chose to file an application under section 12(2), C.P.C. for setting aside the ex parte order/decree dated 28-9-1987 passed by learned trial Court, as also the order dated 23-12-1990 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Khanewal. The original decree was passed on 28-9-1987. The application to set aside the said decree was filed on 2-10-1991. The same was thus barred by time.\n  11. Besides the learned Additional District Judge correctly observed in his judgment dated 22-4-1993 that as the decree dated 28-9-1987 was passed by the learned trial Court and not by the learned Additional District Judge, therefore, the application under section 12(2), C.P.C. was not filed before the learned trial Court who had passed the decree dated 28-9-1987.

Ejectment was claimed on grounds of default from January, 1978 till filing of the ejectment application, impairment and damage to the property and bona fide personal need. The application was dismissed by the Rent Controller vide order dated 8-3-2002 and the order was upheld by the Appellate Court vide its order dated 6-10-2005. Earlier to this ejectment application another ejectment application had been filed in respect of the same property against the same tenant and that ejectment application though was allowed by the Courts below however, the Supreme Court allowed appeal and set aside concurrent judgment of the two Courts below. Both the learned counsel who appeared, submitted that the earlier application had been filed on ground of impairment and material damage to the property.\n  2. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted, that he is not pressing ground of damage/impairment and also ground of default and would argue only ground of bona fide personal need. He submitted that this ground has been stated in the ejectment application as well as in the affidavit-in-evidence. He further submitted that it is a right of the landlord to decide as to his need and as to suitability of any particular premises for his or his family's needs. He relied upon Mazharuddin v. Hussain Bakhsh and 2 others, PLD 2005 Kar. 205, Sultan Ahmad, v. Additional District Judge-1, Karachi South, 2006 CLC 99 and Muhammad Anwar Azim and another v. R.I.G. Education Board through Directress/General Secretary PLD 2003 Kar. 34. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that another hotel in the same premises is available to the landlord and therefore it is available to the landlord to seek eviction of the present respondent. She also submitted that this case has been filed quick on the heel on dismissal of earlier case by the honourable Supreme Court. She further submitted that the property is owned by a number of person and it has not been stated as to which one requires the property and partition of property has been pleaded. She relied upon Haji Abdullah Jan v. Anwar Khan, PLD 2000 SC 787. She further submitted that this constitution petition was filed in 2005 and no attempt for its expeditious disposal has been made for four years.\n  3. I have considered the submission made by the learned counsel and have also gone through the record as well as case-law cited by the learned counsel.\n  4. As far as, question of using another business premises, Muslim Hotel, it was stated in the cross-examination that it was admitted as correct by the Applicant No.1 in his evidence that Muslim Hotel is in the front of the building and that accommodation in Muslim Hotel is almost the same. He further stated \"It is incorrect that Muslim Hotel will be vacated in the near future.\" Therefore, the Muslim Hotel was not available as vacant property when ejectment application was filed. It is choice of the landlord to decide as to which property is more suitable to his requirements. Thus, where the landlord owns more properties in the same building or in the same locality, the landlord (sic) would be more suitable to his requirements. Neither the tenant nor Court can sit in judgment over such a right of, and exercise of such a right, by the landlord. However, when any other property is vacant and available, it is essential for the landlord to state as to how and on what basis the available property is not suitable to his requirements. But this is not the case here. Here at the time of filing of ejectment application Muslim Hotel was not a vacant property. Therefore, factum of existence of Muslim Hotel cannot knock out case of the landlord.\n  5. It is true that this ejectment application was filed after decision was rendered by the Supreme Court in the earlier matter. But the earlier matter was in respect of only damage/impairment. Since the learned counsel for the petitioners has given up that ground I do not think earlier judgment of the Supreme Court would stand in his way.\n  6. However, the third submission urged by the learned counsel for the respondent carries weight. Haji Abdullah Jan's case is on the question of co-owners. The following was observed:---\n  \"(12) Coming to the merits of the case, it is noted nothing concrete has been brought on record to show that the property was actually portioned among the co-owners nor even portions to be owned by the co-owners, are shown. The evidence was insufficient to justify eviction of the respondent on the ground of alleged bona fide personal use. Although a plea was taken that building was to be reconstructed having two shops and a restaurant in the portion in possession of the respondent but such substantial evidence to that effect was missing.\"\n  7. In the present case, the petitioners are Hafiz Ferozuddin, his wife and his brother. They were also three applicants in the Court of Rent Controller. Only Hafiz Ferozuddin filed his affidavit-in-evidence and in respect of personal bona fide need he stated as under:---\n  \"That I submit and say that the said shop is required for our personal bona fide use and for use of our/my son and we want to start our own business in the said shop, the said shop is very much and most suitable for our need and for our son.\"\n  8. During cross-examination he admitted that he had three sons and their respective ages were 27 years, 20 years and 15 years. He also admitted that younger son is a student while others are engaged in their businesses. He stated that they did not have any business place. He further stated that he deals in the business of threading at Shah Faisal Colony. He admitted that his brother and co-petitioner has three sons and their ages respectively were 29 years, 26 years and 13 years and the elder two sons were also doing business. There has not been any partition of the property. There is no statement whatsoever as to who is to conduct business or whether all of them have jointly decided to conduct business. Applicants Nos.2 and 3 did not appear as witnesses and there is no statement that he had been authorized by the co-owners while all the co-owners separately signed the ejectment application; the other co-owners did not appear as witness. All these circumstances hale correctly lead the Courts below to coming to the conclusion that bona fide personal need had not been established. I do not find any reasons for interfering with the conclusion recorded by the Courts below. Consequently this writ petition is dismissed in limine.\n  M.H./F-28/K Petition dismissed.",

But this is not the case here. Here at the time of filing of ejectment application Muslim Hotel was not a vacant property. Therefore, factum of existence of Muslim Hotel cannot knock out case of the landlord.\n  5. It is true that this ejectment application was filed after decision was rendered by the Supreme Court in the earlier matter. But the earlier matter was in respect of only damage/impairment. Since the learned counsel for the petitioners has given up that ground I do not think earlier judgment of the Supreme Court would stand in his way.\n  6. However, the third submission urged by the learned counsel for the respondent carries weight. Haji Abdullah Jan's case is on the question of co-owners. The following was observed:---\n  \"(12) Coming to the merits of the case, it is noted nothing concrete has been brought on record to show that the property was actually portioned among the co-owners nor even portions to be owned by the co-owners, are shown. The evidence was insufficient to justify eviction of the respondent on the ground of alleged bona fide personal use. Although a plea was taken that building was to be reconstructed having two shops and a restaurant in the portion in possession of the respondent but such substantial evidence to that effect was missing.\"\n  7. In the present case, the petitioners are Hafiz Ferozuddin, his wife and his brother. They were also three applicants in the Court of Rent Controller. Only Hafiz Ferozuddin filed his affidavit-in-evidence and in respect of personal bona fide need he stated as under:---\n  \"That I submit and say that the said shop is required for our personal bona fide use and for use of our/my son and we want to start our own business in the said shop, the said shop is very much and most suitable for our need and for our son.\"\n  8. During cross-examination he admitted that he had three sons and their respective ages were 27 years, 20 years and 15 years. He also admitted that younger son is a student while others are engaged in their businesses. He stated that they did not have any business place. He further stated that he deals in the business of threading at Shah Faisal Colony. He admitted that his brother and co-petitioner has three sons and their ages respectively were 29 years, 26 years and 13 years and the elder two sons were also doing business. There has not been any partition of the property. There is no statement whatsoever as to who is to conduct business or whether all of them have jointly decided to conduct business. Applicants Nos.2 and 3 did not appear as witnesses and there is no statement that he had been authorized by the co-owners while all the co-owners separately signed the ejectment application; the other co-owners did not appear as witness.",

JAMILA JAHANOOR ASLAM, J.--- The petitioner contends that respondent No.3 filed a suit for dissolution of her marriage on the grounds of habitual cruelty, physical and mental torture. She also took the ground of second marriage. At the very onset it would be apt to mention here that the petitioner denies his second marriage and respondent No.3 has failed to produce any evidence qua the same.\n  2. On the other hand the petitioner filed a suit for restitution of conjugal rights. The petitioner contended in his suit that as respondent No.3 was living away from the material abode of her own free-will and after sending Jirgas to respondent No.3 to patch' up and due their failure to bring respondent No.3 home he was compelled to file the suit for restitution of conjugal rights. This suit was dismissed.\n  3. When respondent No.3 first filed her suit for dissolution of marriage, the petitioner contested the suit and in his written statement has admitted that 16-1/2 Tolas of gold ornaments along with 6 shops at Station Road, Fateh Jang were given to respondent No.3, which she was liable to return to the petitioner in case respondent No.3 claims dissolution of the marriage.\n  4. The written statement to the suit for dissolution of marriage was filed on 22-6-2006 and 28-6-2006 was the next date, was fixed for reconciliation proceedings, which failed and issues were framed which were: ---\n  (i) Whether suit of the plaintiff is' defective, not proceedable and is liable to be dismissed? OPD\n  (ii) Whether plaintiff is entitled to the decree for dissolution of marriage on the grounds set out in the plaint? OPP\n  5. The suit of respondent No.3 was decreed in her favour vide impugned judgment and, decree dated 5-3-2008.\n  6. The petitioner being aggrieved of the judgment/decree dated 5-3-2008 impugned the same in an appeal. He prayed that the impugned judgment and decree be set aside and the entire dower and other things mentioned in the written statement be returned to the petitioner. The appeal preferred by the petitioner was dismissed vide order dated 17-11-2008. Being further aggrieved the petitioner has invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court on the grounds that both the impugned judgment/decrees of the Court are against the law and facts on file.\n  7. The petitioner contends that as the Family Judge had dissolved the marriage under the provisions of section 10(4), Family Courts Act, 1964 it was incumbent on him to order the restoration of the dower amount which, he failed to do. He has brought to the attention of this Court that prior to the decreed suit for dissolution of marriage respondent No.3 had filed a suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula, which she had withdrawn. This fact has no bearing on the matter in hand.\n  8. The petitioner also avers that the Trial Court has given no finding qua the return of the dower amount as envisaged by section 14(4) Family Courts Act, 1964. The appeal he had filed, he avers, was not against the dissolution of the marriage but only for the return of dower amount and things mentioned in the written statement.\n  9. The counsel for respondent No.3 has vehemently opposed the contentions of the petitioner. His claim is that for a start no appeal lay against a suit for dissolution of marriage and consequently the writ petition too was not maintainable.\n  10. After hearing the arguments of both the counsel and going over the record I have observed that the suit for dissolution of marriage filed by respondent No.3 was on grounds of cruelty and physical and mental abuse/torture.\n  11. It is very difficult to prove grounds of cruelty and physical and mental torture. Nevertheless it is not an unknown phenomenon in our society, or for that matter in any society in the world. It is obvious that the petitioner was living abroad and respondent No.3 didn't have much of a matrimonial life. Moreover, in his evidence the petitioner has stated in no uncertain terms that he plans to get married in a couple of months, so the fact that there is already somebody waiting in the wings for him cannot be ruled out. Matter of fact, it adds credibility to respondent No.3's version that the petitioner has re-married. Re-marriage is to a ground for dissolution of marriage under the Dissolution of Marriages Act, 1939 but the mental torture a women would go through in the case of her husband's second marriage is something that cannot be appreciated by the male gender to its full extent. Thus the contention of respondent No.3 that she has suffered mental torture at the hands of the petitioner stands proved.\n  12. The petitioner has taken a stance that the Family Court failed to frame an issue qua the return of things taken by respondent No.3 at the time of her departure from the marital abode despite his bringing up the point. This is not terrible as he could have filed an application for framing of an extra issue and at least made his demand a part of the Court record.\n  13. The counsel for respondent No.3 has pointed out that in the response to para 6(c), of the plaint where respondent No.3 mentioned the petitioner's second marriage an evasive reply was given. I tend to agree with this.\n  14. The stance of the petitioner that in both the impugned judgments and decrees the provisions of section 10(4) Family Courts Act, 19641 have been misinterpreted and not applied also is not tenable.\n  15. Section 10(4), Family Courts Act, 1964 reads as under:---\n  \"if no compromise or reconciliation is possible the Court shall frame issues in the case and fix a date for recording of evidence\". Provided that notwithstanding any decision or judgment of any Court or Tribunal the Family Court in a suit for dissolution of marriage, if reconciliation fails, shall pass a decree for dissolution of marriage forthwith and shall also restore to the husband the Haq Mehr received by the wife in consideration of marriage at the time of marriage.\"\n  16. Be that as it may, as many as ten grounds are given under the Dissolution of Marriages Act, 1939. Had the intent of the Legislature been to treat these grounds as grounds for Khula this law would have been abrogated a long time back. It has been held in PLD 2002 SC 273 \"Wife would be entitled to recover amount of dower and dowry when marriage is dissolved on various grounds, including Khula. If marriage is dissolved solely on ground of Khula the situation would be different. In such case; it would be examined keeping in view the offer wife made for getting marriage dissolved on ground of Khula\". Section 10(4) pertains only to marriages dissolved on grounds of Khula. In present case respondent No.3 did not ask for her marriage to be dissolved on grounds of Khula\". She is thus found entitled to keep whatsoever she has acquired by reason of her Nikah to the petitioner despite her decree for dissolution of marriage.\n  Writ petition disposed of.\n  M.U.Y./M-371/L Order accordingly.",

The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner, an MBA, is the sole proprietor of Messrs Raja Enterprises---dealing in export of seafood and is a frequent traveller abroad in connection with his business activities. The petitioner is also an income tax payee. Since, the petitioner is a frequent traveller in connection with his business as well as to visit his parents, who are settled in the United Kingdom, he has filed the present petition seeking inter alia the above prayer.\n  3. According to learned counsel Mr. Amir Mansoob Qureshi, previously the petitioner acted as an informer to the Anti Narcotic Force for some time and helped the. government in arresting drug' dealers and drug traffickers in a number of cases and recovery of huge quantity of contraband items. But, when due to some personal reasons he refused to act in such capacity, the A.N.F. authorities turned against him and started causing harassment to him. It is alleged that the A.N.F. authorities also threatened him with involvement in false cases. In this regard the petitioner filed C. P. No, S-310/2007 which was disposed of vide Judgment dated 9-8-2007 through which he came to know that he has been involved in two cases, being FJ.R. No.2/2005 of Police Station A.N.F., Clifton and F.I.R. No.367/06 of Police Station Boat Basin, respectively under sections 6/9(c) and 6/9(b) of the CNS Act. After obtaining bail after arrest in Crime No.2/2005 and bail before arrest in Criine No.367/2006, the petitioner filed an application under section 265-K, Cr.P.C. in Special Case No.6/2005, pertaining to F.I.R. No.2/2005, which was allowed vide order dated 7-7-2008 and the petitioner was acquitted. The A.N.F. authorities filed Criminal Appeal No.13/2009 challenging the above order before this Court. This criminal appeal, however, was dismissed vide order dated 24-2-2009 and the acquittal order of the trial Court was maintained. Against these concurrent orders that A.N.F. has filed a civil petition for leave to appeal which is pending. The petitioner also filed an application under section 265-K, Cr.P.C. in Special Court No.170/2006 pertaining to F.I.R. No.367/2006 of Police Station Boat Basin, which was also allowed by acquitting the petitioner vide order dated 14-10-2009. However, as per petitioner's counsel, no appeal so far has been filed against this order. The learned counsel also submits that the petitioner proposes to proceed to Saudi Arabia for performing Hajj with his family and in this regard has also placed before us certain documents including deposit slip of National Bank of Pakistan, Haj Application, etc.\n  4. Learned counsel for the petitioner further states that now when the petitioner has been acquitted in both the cases in which he was falsely involved and no restraining order has been obtained from the honourable Supreme Court in the pending C.P.L.A., placement of the name of the petitioner on the ECL is in violation of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to every citizen of Pakistan under Articles 4, 9; 14, 15 and 25 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Therefore, he prays that the petition may be allowed and the name of the petitioner may be removed from the ECL and he may be allowed to travel abroad.\n  5. In support of his contentions the learned counsel relied on the following reported judgments:---\n  (1) Saleem Akhtar v. Federation of Pakistan and another PLD 1999 Kar. 177, (2) Hashmat Ali Chawla v. Federation of Pakistan and others PLD 2003 Kar. 705, (3) Khan Muhammad Mahar v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2005 Kar. 252, (4) Abdul Qayyum Khan v. Federal Government of Pakistan and others Fi,D 2009 Kar. 361, (5) Kishwar Jabeen v. Federation of Pakistan and others 2005 YLR 2438 and (6) Mirza Ashfaq Beg v. Federation of Pakistan and another 2005 MLD 1698.\n  6. Syed Ashfaq Hussain Rizvi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of A.N.F., submitted that against the acquittal order of the petitioner passed in Special Case No.6/2005 and affirmed by this Court in Criminal Appeal No.13 of 2009, a C.P.L.A. has been filed by the A.N.F. before the honourable Supreme Court, which is pending decision. In para 7 of the comments filed on behalf of A.N.F. it is stated that \"A.N.F. has filed C.P.L.A. before the Honourable Supreme Court against impugned judgment\". He also submits that so far as the decision of the trial Court dated 4-10-2009 in respect of F.I.R. No.367/06 is concerned, there is every possibility that the department might file a criminal appeal -before this Court against the same. Learned counsel also submitted, but without much vehemence, that the petitioner being an ex-informer of the A.N.F., in fact, had relations with international drug dealers/barons. He prayed that the decision on this petition may be deferred till decision of the appeal pending before the apex Court.\n  7. Ms. Cookie Rawat, learned standing counsel, appearing on behalf of the State, adopted the arguments of Mr. S. Ashfaq Hussain Rizvi, Advocate but stated that the name of the petitioner was put on the ECL as two criminal cases were pending against him before the Special Court. According to her, since C.P.L.A. is pending against the petitioner before the honourable Supreme Court, therefore, this petition is premature. She further submitted that the name of the petitioner may not be removed from the ECL as there is strong apprehension that once he goes out of the Country he might not come back. In the end she prayed that this petition may be dismissed.\n  8. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the record and the case-law cited before us.\n  9. We have observed that the name of the petitioner was placed on the ECL on the ground that certain criminal cases were pending against him vide Memorandum No.1/216/2007-ECL dated August 25, 2007 under section 2 of Exit from Pakistan (Control) Ordinance, 1981. As evident from the facts narrated above, the petitioner has been acquitted in both the cases lodged against him. Against one of the acquittal orders, passed in Special Case No.6/05, a criminal appeal was filed before this Court which was dismissed and against such order of dismissal a civil petition for leave to appeal has been filed before the honourable Supreme Court. However, so far no appeal has been filed against the other order of acquittal passed in Special Case No.170/06. Thus, the only case now pending against the present petitioner is the C.P.L.A. before the honourable Supreme Court. Now, we will proceed to examine the impact of such pendency on the fate of this petition.\n  10. In the case of Mirza Ashfaq Beg (supra), the name of the petitioner (Mirza Ashfaq Beg) was placed on ECL and counsel for NAB stated that \"deletion of the petitioner's name from ECL is being opposed by his client on account of the fact that the petition for leave to appeal before the Honourable Supreme Court is still pending. (emphasis supplied).\n  11. It would be seen that the petition in hand is identical to the above reported case inasmuch as in both the cases removal of the name of the petitioner from the ECL was resisted on the sole ground that a C.P.L.A. is pending before the Honourable Supreme Court. The learned Division Bench in this regard held as under:\n  \"We regret we find no force in the above ground urged. Admittedly the order of acquittal passed by this Court has taken effect for all legal purposes and has not been suspended or modified by the Honourable Supreme Court. Even an interim restraint on the petitioner's right to travel abroad has not been obtained.\"\n  12. Thus, the contention of the learned counsel for A.N.F. that the name of the petitioner cannot be removed from ECL on the ground that a C.P.L.A. is pending before the Honourable Supreme Court is not tenable.\n  13. In the case of Abdul Qayyum Khan, the learned Bench observed that in the Memorandum issued by the Ministry of Interior no reason whatsoever was given for placing the name of the petitioner in the ECL except acting as a rubber stamp abdicating its jurisdiction to intelligence agencies. The learned Bench thereafter declared the said Memorandum to be absolutely void ab initio and without lawful authority. In the instant petition also we have found that in the impugned Memorandum, dated 25-8-2007, issued by the Ministry of Interior no reason has been given by the said Ministry regarding placing the name of the petition in the ECL, except observing that \"it has been decided to place the name of the following persons on ECL.\"\n  14. Now we come to the question of the right of the petitioner to travel abroad. By reading the provisions of Articles 4, 9 and 15 of the Constitution it is clear that every citizen has the liberty to go abroad and to enter Pakistan unless he is precluded from doing so under some law made in the public interest. In this regard it would be advantageous to discuss the case-law cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner in this regard.\n  15. In the case of Saleem Akhtar (supra), Rana Bhagwan Das, J. (as he then was), held as under:---\n  \"It appears that no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person can be taken except in due course of law and the Constitution guarantees that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law. Article 15 reproduced hereinabove guarantees to every citizen his right to remain in, enter and move freely throughout Pakistan. Such right to enter the country if he is leaving it or he has gone abroad and is allowed to step out and step in, the country, may be subject to restriction imposed by law in the public interest. In the case in hand there is nothing on record and indeed none is pointed by the learned State Counsel to reflect whether the petitioner was going abroad to hatch any conspiracy against the national interest or his visit abroad could endanger the security of the State or was contrary to public interest.\"\n  16. In the case of Hashmat Ali Chawla (supra), the learned Bench, comprising of Mr. Shabbir Ahmed and one of us namely Mr. Gulzar Ahmed JJ. observed as under:---\n  \"It is well-settled that every citizen shall have the right to remain in, enter and move freely throughout Pakistan and to reside and settle in any part thereof but this is subject to any 'reasonable restriction. Indeed the power purportedly vested in the Federal Government is apparently unfettered and unrestricted, it is well-settled that the discretion vested in Executive must be exercised fairly, reasonably, justly and in accordance with law and the Constitution. In absence of any incriminating xu3terial available with the respondent-Government against the petitioner tending to show that he was involved in any serious kind of nefarious activities or acting prejudicial to the security and solidarity of the State, impugned order cannot be sustained in law inasmuch as not a single instance of involvement of the petitioner in any serious crime is shown to exist. The reasons for placing the name .of the petitioner was on account of his illegal construction in violation of the approved plan, which is subject to condonation/regularization under the law i.e. Sindh Regulation and Control (Use of Plots and Construction of Buildings) Ordinance, 2002.\"\n  17. In the case of Kishwar Jabeen (supra), it was held that \"The petitioners cannot be deprived from their constitutional rights for indefinite period and no action detrimental to life and liberty of a citizen can be taken except in accordance with law. In the same judgment the above quoted portion from the case of Hashmat Ali Chawla (supra) was quoted with approval.\n  18. In the case of Khan Muhammad Mahar (supra), referring to the cases relied upon the learned counsel for the petitioner, it was held as under:--\n  \"In the cases referred by the learned counsel for petitioner, precisely, it has been held by the superior Courts that liberty of every citizen of this country is safeguarded/guaranteed under Articles 4, 9, 14 and 15 of the Constitution, thus, it is to be jealously safeguarded and any action without sufficient cause depriving/curtailing the liberty of a citizen is not warranted by law and liable to be struck down. Further, it has been held that an arbitrary action under section 2 of the Exit from Pakistan (Control) Ordinance 1981, is not immune from scrutiny by this Court in exercise of its powers under Article 199 of the Constitution.\n  (6) In the instant case after going through the whole material placed on record we are clear in our mind that the action of the respondents in placing the name of the petitioner on the Exit Control List is wholly arbitrary, unjust, without any valid reason and violative of his fundamental rights.\"\n  In view of the above discussion we are of the considered view that after the acquittal of the petitioner in the two cases lodged against him there was no occasion to keep his name on the ECL solely on the ground that a C.P.L.A. is pending against one of the order of acquittal and, consequently, in view of the judgments cited before us and discussed above, there is no justification for depriving the petitioner from his this fundamental right to leave and enter the Country unless otherwise barred.\n  20. For the foregoing reasons, this petition was allowed by us by short order dated 29-10-2009 and these are the reasons for the same. The respondents are directed to remove the name of the petitioner from ECL and allow him to travel abroad for any lawful purpose on valid travel documents.\n  21. There shall however be no order as to costs.\n  S.A.K./B-31/K Petition accepted.",

      "case_proceddings": "According to learned counsel Mr. Amir Mansoob Qureshi, previously the petitioner acted as an informer to the Anti Narcotic Force for some time and helped the. government in arresting drug' dealers and drug traffickers in a number of cases and recovery of huge quantity of contraband items. But, when due to some personal reasons he refused to act in such capacity, the A.N.F. authorities turned against him and started causing harassment to him. It is alleged that the A.N.F. authorities also threatened him with involvement in false cases. In this regard the petitioner filed C. P.

Riaz Ahmad for Respondents Nos. 1 and 2.\n  Maqsood Hassan for Respondents Nos.3 to 5.\n    ORDER\n  ASAD MUNIR, J.- This civil revision filed by Mst. Parveen Akhtar, calls in question the judgment and decree dated 19-5-2009 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Jhelum, whereby the appeal filed by respondents Nos.1 and 2 has been accepted and the judgment and decree dated 28-1-2008 passed by learned Civil Judge, Jhelum, has been set aside.\n  2. The brief facts forming the background of this petition are that the petitioner along with her two minor sons namely, Aman and Faizan, as well as respondents Nos.1 and 2 are the legal heirs of late Khurshid Ahmad who died on 16-6-2001. Petitioner is the widow of late Khurshid Ahmad while respondents Nos.1 and 2 are the children of late Khurshid Ahmad out of his marriage with Mst. Shafqat Bibi who was divorced by Khurshid Ahmad before his death. During his life time, late Khurshid Ahmad insured his life through two Insurance policies one issued by Eastern Federal Life Insurance' and the other by Postal Life Insurance. The said policies became payable on the death of late Khurshid Ahmad and a sum of Rs.10,72,500 became due on account of the said policies. On 27-7-2001, respondents Nos.1 and 2 through their mother filed a suit for declaration and permanent injunction against respondents Nos.3 to 5 who were responsible for the issuance of the aforesaid life Insurance Policies. The respondents Nos. 3 to 5 filed their written statement on 28-1-2003 wherein it was stated that the petitioner, being a nominee in the said insurance policies, had received from them the insurance amount to the tune of Rs.10,72,500.The learned trial Court vide its judgment and decree dated 28-1-2008 dismissed the suit of respondents Nos.1 and 2 whereupon an appeal was preferred which was allowed by the learned Additional District Judge, Jhelum vide his judgment and decree dated 19-5-2009. In terms of the judgment and decree dated 19-5-2009, the suit was decreed in favour of respondents Nos. 1 and 2 to the extent that the respondents Nos. 1 and 2 were declared to be entitled to recover 3/8th share from the amounts of the insurance policies from the petitioner. Now through this writ petition the petitioners have assailed the judgment and decree dated 19-5-2009 by contending that petitioner No.1 being the nominee in the insurance policies, was the sole beneficiary and could keep the insurance monies to the exclusion of other heirs. Reliance has been placed on PLD 1991 SC 731 wherein the Shariat Appellate Bench of the honourable Supreme Court has held that amounts due on account of benevolent fund and group insurance are not part of the estate as these assets are not acquired by the deceased during his life-time. It is also contended that the impugned judgment and decree does not take into account the fact that some debts out of the insurance money were paid on behalf of the deceased on account of installments payable in respect of some plot in the name of the deceased. Thirdly, it has been contended that recovery of money against the petitioners could not have been ordered as the suit of respondents Nos.1 and 2, as framed, did not seek such relief.\n  3. After going through the record as well as the respective contentions of the learned counsel for the parties, it appears that the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is misconceived as the nominee under an insurance policy is a mere trustee of the amount received and cannot appropriate the same to his use or benefit but is bound to distribute the amount of insurance policy among the legal heirs as per their entitlement. There can be no debate on this point as the honourable Supreme Court in Mst. Omat-ul-Habib and others v. Mst. Musarrat Parveen PLD 1974 SC 185, has laid down as under: --\n  \"The nomination merely confers a right to collect the money or to receive the money. It does not operate either as a gift or as a will and, therefore, cannot deprive the other heirs of the nominator who may be entitled thereto under the law of succession applicable to the deceased. The nominees thus collect as a trustee for the benefit of all persons entitled to inherit from the deceased employee.\"\n  The ruling of the honourable Supreme Court has been followed in Messrs Latif Ibrahim Jamal v. Controller of Estate Duty 1989 PTD 1027 and Mrs. Shaista Younas Khan and others v. Mrs. Asia Khatoon and others 1995 PLD 560, wherein while interpreting sections 38 and 39 of the Insurance Act, 1938, it was held that nominee in an insurance policy is a mere trustee who is bound to distribute the insurance monies among the legal heirs.\n  4. I also think PLD 1991 Supreme Court 731 is not applicable to the facts of the present case as the issue raised therein before the Shariat Appellate Bench of the honourable Supreme Court related to the entitlement of the nominee to benevolent fund under the Federal Employee's Benevolent Fund and Group Insurance Act, 1964. In this regard, I refer to the last para of the aforesaid judgment wherein it is made clear that the question of entitlement of a nominee under group insurance by reference to Shariat was not addressed as it was not part of the subject-matter of the appeal.\n  5. The present case simply involves the question of distribution of insurance money among the legal heirs which include not just the petitioner as a nominee but others including respondents Nos.1 and 2. Keeping in view the foregoing discussion, I have no hesitation in saying that the petitioner had no right to deny the other heirs from receiving their shares as per their entitlement. The plea of the petitioner that the insurance money received has been utilized for re-payment of the debts of the deceased due in respect of remaining instalments for plot which he had purchased, does not appear to be supported by record. As regards the ground of suit not being properly framed either the Civil Judge has inherent powers to take notice of subsequent events and do justice to save the parties from unnecessary litigation.\n  4.(sic) For the reasons discussed above, I see no infirmity, illegality or irregularity on the part of the Courts below who have exercised their jurisdiction lawfully. No interference is called for by this Court in its revisional jurisdiction, therefore, this civil revision is dismissed with no order as to costs.\n  S.A.K./P-39/L Petition dismissed.",

Petitioner is the widow of late Khurshid Ahmad while respondents Nos.1 and 2 are the children of late Khurshid Ahmad out of his marriage with Mst. Shafqat Bibi who was divorced by Khurshid Ahmad before his death. During his life time, late Khurshid Ahmad insured his life through two Insurance policies one issued by Eastern Federal Life Insurance' and the other by Postal Life Insurance. The said policies became payable on the death of late Khurshid Ahmad and a sum of Rs.10,72,500 became due on account of the said policies. On 27-7-2001, respondents Nos.1 and 2 through their mother filed a suit for declaration and permanent injunction against respondents Nos.3 to 5 who were responsible for the issuance of the aforesaid life Insurance Policies. The respondents Nos. 3 to 5 filed their written statement on 28-1-2003 wherein it was stated that the petitioner, being a nominee in the said insurance policies, had received from them the insurance amount to the tune of Rs.10,72,500.The learned trial Court vide its judgment and decree dated 28-1-2008 dismissed the suit of respondents Nos.1 and 2 whereupon an appeal was preferred which was allowed by the learned Additional District Judge, Jhelum vide his judgment and decree dated 19-5-2009. In terms of the judgment and decree dated 19-5-2009, the suit was decreed in favour of respondents Nos. 1 and 2 to the extent that the respondents Nos. 1 and 2 were declared to be entitled to recover 3/8th share from the amounts of the insurance policies from the petitioner. Now through this writ petition the petitioners have assailed the judgment and decree dated 19-5-2009 by contending that petitioner No.1 being the nominee in the insurance policies, was the sole beneficiary and could keep the insurance monies to the exclusion of other heirs. Reliance has been placed on PLD 1991 SC 731 wherein the Shariat Appellate Bench of the honourable Supreme Court has held that amounts due on account of benevolent fund and group insurance are not part of the estate as these assets are not acquired by the deceased during his life-time. It is also contended that the impugned judgment and decree does not take into account the fact that some debts out of the insurance money were paid on behalf of the deceased on account of installments payable in respect of some plot in the name of the deceased. Thirdly, it has been contended that recovery of money against the petitioners could not have been ordered as the suit of respondents Nos.1 and 2, as framed, did not seek such relief.",

EBRAHIM, J.--- This application has been filed by defendant No.1 under Order XL, rule 1, C.P.C. read with section 151 C.P.C. for appointment of Receiver with full powers in respect of suit property viz. Flat No.F-2/4, 3rd Floor, Maymar Heights, Block 14, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Karachi; including the power of removing any person(s) acting through on behalf of deceased plaintiff.\n  It is the case of defendant No.1, that he has purchased the suit property from the deceased plaintiff for valuable sale consideration through registered sale-deed on 18-7-2005, the possession of the suit property was not taken and the deceased plaintiff continued to remain in possession of the suit property as tenant of defendant No.1 for which tenancy agreement was executed on 1-8-2005. However, it is the case of the plaintiffs that their father who had filed this suit was the lawful owner of the suit property, he did not sell the suit property to defendant No.1, the possession of the suit property had always remained with the deceased plaintiff and after his death in possession of the legal heirs and defendant No.1 who is an estate agent, fraudulently obtained the sale-deed in his name in the garb of registration of general power of attorney/sub-general power of attorney by the deceased plaintiff in favour of his son.\n  Prior to filing of this application the original plaintiff has expired and his legal heirs have been impleaded in this suit.\n  The learned counsel for defendant No.1 submits that defendant No.1 is working in Dubai as an IT professional. Defendant No.1 on payment of the full and final sale consideration had purchased the suit property from the deceased plaintiff vide sale-deed dated 18-7-2005 and on the request of the deceased plaintiff possession of the suit property was not taken and instead the deceased plaintiff was allowed to continue in possession of the suit property as tenant of defendant No.1 vide tenancy agreement dated 1-8-2005. The learned counsel of defendant No.1 contends that defendant No.1 has not played any fraud and the sale-deed is for lawful consideration as the deceased plaintiff had executed and registered the sale-deed without any coercion or under influence before the concerned Sub-Registrar (defendant No.2). Learned counsel for defendant No.1 has argued that the suit property has been found in possession of one Owais Ahmed as per report of the Commissioner dated (presented on) 25-7-2008. It has been vehemently argued that defendant No.1 is the lawful owner of the suit property and Mr. Owais Ahmad who was found to be in possession of the suit property is not the legal heir of the deceased plaintiff and is a stranger to the suit, and hence it would be in the interest of justice that receiver should be appointed to preserve the said property as prayed.\n  It is contended by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs (the legal heirs) that the deceased plaintiff was nearly 87 years old, not keeping good health and was living alone as all his children were residing abroad at the time of alleged fraudulent and collusive registration of the sale-deed of the suit property. That defendant No. 1 being an estate agent, through whom the deceased plaintiff had previously also sold another property has played fraud upon the deceased plaintiff and was fraudulently able to obtain the signatures on the sale deed in respect of the suit property in his favour; whereas the deceased plaintiff wanted to transfer suit property in his favour, whereas the deceased plaintiff wanted to transfer suit property in favour of his son through general power of attorney/sub-power of attorney. The deceased plaintiff on coming to know about this mischief and fraud had filed an F.I.R. and thereafter filed this suit against defendants for declaration, injunction, cancellation of documents and damages against the defendants. The learned counsel for the plaintiffs has stated that Mr. Owais Ahmed who was found to be in possession at the time of inspection by the Commissioner is the real nephew of the deceased plaintiff and was duly authorized by the legal heirs of the deceased plaintiff to occupy the suit property to protect and preserve the suit property and he had not claimed possession in his own personal right. The learned counsel vehemently argued that defendant No.1 has obtained the sale-deed fraudulently and defendant No.1 has never been in physical possession of the suit property. It has. been submitted by the learned counsel that defendant No.1 has not even alleged in his application and accompanying affidavit that there is even any apprehension and fear that the suit property is being damaged or wasted and even as per the Commissioner report, the suit property was found to be in good condition. He has prayed for dismissal of this application.\n  Both the learned counsel have cited various case-laws on the question of appointment of receiver. Since the principles of appointment of receiver are well-settled, I will not dilate upon the said case-laws referred by the learned counsel of the parties, as the facts in the cited case-laws were not similar to the present case, which is indeed quite peculiar in nature.\n  After perusal of the case and hearing the arguments of the learned counsel of the parties and without dilating on the question of the sale of the suit Property which can only be decided after recording of evidence and hearing arguments of the learned counsel, it is sufficient to conclude that the physical possession of suit property has always remained in the possession of the deceased plaintiff and after his death the suit property has remained in the possession of the present plaintiffs and not strangers. Even as per the claim of defendant No.1 is to be accepted, still then the suit property was in possession of deceased plaintiff as tenant (inducted by defendant No.1 himself) and after his death the legal heirs in possession of the suit property are entitled to enjoy the benefits of the suit property as tenants in accordance with law.\n  From the arguments of the learned counsel of defendant No.1, this Court is not able to come to the conclusion that it is just and convenient to appoint a receiver in the instant case, more particularly when (a) the said property was never in possession of defendant No.1, (b) the possession of the suit property have always been with the deceased plaintiff and after his death with the legal heirs of the deceased plaintiffs as owners (as alleged by plaintiffs) or as tenant of defendant No.1 (as alleged by defendant No.1), (c) preservation, damage and wastage of the suit property has not been alleged by defendant No.1, and (d) issues have been settled and commissioner has been appointed to record the evidence within three months vide order dated 27-10-2009.\n  For the foregoing facts' and reasons, this Court has come to the conclusion that it is not just and convenient to impose the harsh remedy of appointing receiver in this case.

Butt for Petitioner.\n  Mian Tariq Manzoor for Respondent No.1.\n    ORDER\n  IJAZ-UL-AHSAN, J.---Short question involved in this petition is whether it is incumbent upon the Family Court to pass a decree for dissolution of marriage forthwith in case pre-trial reconciliation efforts fail.\n  2. The learned counsel for the petitioner states that it is common ground between the parties that pre-trial reconciliation efforts failed, however, instead of passing a decree for dissolution of marriage in terms of the proviso to section 10 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, the learned trial Court has proceeded to frame issues and is in the process of conducting a trial while keeping the marriage intact. It is submitted that the said act on the part of the learned trial Court is illegal in view of the express powers granted to it by virtue of insertion of the aforesaid proviso by Family Courts Ordinance (Ordinance No.LV) of 2002 dated 1-10-2002.\n  3. The learned counsel for the respondent argues that there is an allegation in the pleadings of the parties that some gold ornaments were given to the bride at the time of her marriage and the respondent is claiming return of said gold ornaments. He argues that as long as the gold ornaments in addition to Haq Mehr received by the bride is not returned the marriage cannot be dissolved.\n  4. The proviso of section 10(4) of the West Pakistan Family Courts, Act, 1964 has been examined. It is quite categoric in its intent, purpose and language and is reproduced as follows:---\n  Section 10(4) If no compromise or reconciliation is possible the Court shall frame the issues in the case and fix a date for [the recording of the evidence[:]\n  [Provided that notwithstanding any decision or judgment of any Court or Tribunal, the Family Court in a suit for dissolution of marriage, if reconciliation fails, shall pass decree for dissolution of marriage forthwith and shall also restore to the husband the Haq Mehr received by the wife in consideration of marriage at the time of marriage.]\n  It is apparent from a plain reading of the aforesaid proviso that the Family Court has been empowered in a suit for dissolution of marriage, on failure of pre-trial reconciliation proceedings to pass a decree for dissolution of marriage forthwith and restore to the husband Haq Mehr received by the wife in consideration of marriage at the time of marriage.

      "case_proceddings": "2. The learned counsel for the petitioner states that it is common ground between the parties that pre-trial reconciliation efforts failed, however, instead of passing a decree for dissolution of marriage in terms of the proviso to section 10 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, the learned trial Court has proceeded to frame issues and is in the process of conducting a trial while keeping the marriage intact. It is submitted that the said act on the part of the learned trial Court is illegal in view of the express powers granted to it by virtue of insertion of the aforesaid proviso by Family Courts Ordinance (Ordinance No.LV) of 2002 dated 1-10-2002.\r\n  3. The learned counsel for the respondent argues that there is an allegation in the pleadings of the parties that some gold ornaments were given to the bride at the time of her marriage and the respondent is claiming return of said gold ornaments. He argues that as long as the gold ornaments in addition to Haq Mehr received by the bride is not returned the marriage cannot be dissolved.\r\n  4. The proviso of section 10(4) of the West Pakistan Family Courts, Act, 1964 has been examined. It is quite categoric in its intent, purpose and language and is reproduced as follows:---\r\n  Section 10(4) If no compromise or reconciliation is possible the Court shall frame the issues in the case and fix a date for [the recording of the evidence[:]\r\n  [Provided that notwithstanding any decision or judgment of any Court or Tribunal, the Family Court in a suit for dissolution of marriage, if reconciliation fails, shall pass decree for dissolution of marriage forthwith and shall also restore to the husband the Haq Mehr received by the wife in consideration of marriage at the time of marriage.]\r\n  It is apparent from a plain reading of the aforesaid proviso that the Family Court has been empowered in a suit for dissolution of marriage, on failure of pre-trial reconciliation proceedings to pass a decree for dissolution of marriage forthwith and restore to the husband Haq Mehr received by the wife in consideration of marriage at the time of marriage. The real intention behind insertion of the aforesaid proviso was to cut-short the process of a protracted trial in suits for dissolution of marriage and save the woman the agony of going through a drawn legal process. An effort appears to have been made to lessen and relieve the effects of the oft-repeated cliche \"Justice delayed is justice denied.\"\r\n  5.

Going beyond the language of the proviso and reading other matters in it will invariably lead to undesirable results which would defeat and nullify the intents and purpose for which the amendment was made. The proviso is in the nature of non obstante clause and overrides the sequential order given in section 10(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964.

EBRAHIM, J.--- For hearing of C.M.A. No.6666 of 2006: This application under Order VII, rule 10, C.P.C. read with section 151, C.P.C. has been filed on behalf of the defendant with the prayer that this Court may be pleased to return the plaint to the plaintiff to be presented to the Court in which the suit should have been instituted on the grounds of lack of territorial jurisdiction of this Court.\n  The learned counsel for the defendant submits that the defendant actually resides and carries on business at Faisalabad (Punjab) which fact is evident from the title of the plaint as well as the documents annexed to the plaint. The defendant does not have any place of business or residence at Karachi. The defendant has not purchased any cotton from the plaintiff, no cotton has been supplied by the plaintiff to the defendant and no payment has been made by the defendant to the plaintiff as alleged in the plaint. The learned counsel for the defendant further submits that both residential and business addresses of the defendant shown in the plaint are of Faisalabad. The alleged notices have been addressed by the plaintiff to the defendant at Faisalabad. The alleged delivery orders and gate passes annexed with the plaint are in respect of the Mills situated at Muzaffargarh. Learned counsel for defendant has argued that no evidence has been provided by the plaintiff in respect of payment of cheques or sale tax challans (statutory requirements) in respect of the alleged transactions. He has argued that from the averments of the plaint and the annexure it can be reasonably and rationally concluded that no cause of action has accrued at Karachi and prays that his application may be allowed as prayed as this Court lacks' the territorial jurisdiction to grant the relief prayed by the plaintiff and the plaint may be returned to the plaintiff to be presented in the Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the defendant actually resides and is doing business.\n  Learned counsel for the plaintiff has contended that the registered office of the plaintiff's company is situated in Karachi and has place of business at Punjab. It has been further contended that the defendant has been doing business with the plaintiff since 2001 and has obtained different quantities of cotton from the plaintiff and the plaintiff in good faith delivered the cotton yarn of cumulatively amounting to Rs.350 millions and as on 20-7-2004 a sum of Rs.71,55,045.45 is outstanding against the defendant. Learned counsel further submits that notices have been issued by the plaintiff from the registered office of the Company, situated at Karachi, delivery orders and gate passes were also issued from the Head Office situated in Karachi and payment by the defendant was made to the plaintiff at Karachi. The learned counsel for the plaintiff has vehemently argued that part of cause of action had arisen at Karachi and this Court has jurisdiction 'and or at least concurrent jurisdiction to try this suit and, therefore, this application of the defendant should be dismissed. The learned counsel of the plaintiff has also argued that sections 16, 17 and 20, C.P.C. as well as Order VII, rule 10 and Order XLIX, rule 3, C.P.C. are not applicable in Original Civil Jurisdiction in view of section 120, C.P.C. and this Court has inherent territorial jurisdiction to try this suit and in support to his contentions he has relied on the following reported cases:---\n  (i) 2007 CLC 394, (ii) 2007 YLR 21, (iii) 2007 YLR 2724, (iv) PLD 1997 Lah. 643, (v) PLD 2002 Kar. 420, (vi) 1997 SCMR 1874; and (vii) 1985 SCMR 758.\n  The learned counsel for the defendant has argued that no cause of action has arisen to the plaintiff and just having registered office at Karachi or place of business from where the plaintiff had issued notices or delivery orders and gate passes are not relevant factors in determining the territorial limits of jurisdiction within the meaning of the law. The plaintiff cannot pick and choose the territory to proceed with the suit. The learned counsel vehemently argues that no cause or any part of cause of action has accrued to the plaintiff within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. As to the legal contentions raised by the learned counsel of the plaintiff, the learned counsel of the defendant has relied on the following reported cases:\n  (i) 1993 CLC 1993 1627 (Karachi) and (ii) 2005' MLD 1506 (Karachi).\n  My lordships Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali and Justice Ali Aslam Jafri, in the above cited case of Murlidhar P. Gangwani (Engineer) versus Engineer Aftab Islam and others, reported in 2005 MLD 1506 Karachi, after fully discussing the legal issue and after discussing and all the relevant cases referred therein were pleased to observe as under:---\n  \"The submissions of Mr. Khawaja Shamsul Islam with reference to non-applicability of sections 16, 17 and 20, C.P.C. to the High Court in exercise of its original jurisdiction, by virtue of section 120 C.P.C., Is without force and of no help to the appellant as this legal aspect has been dilated in a prudent manner in the case of Messrs Muslim Commercial Bank. Limited v. Messrs Nisar Rice Mills and another 1993 CLC 1627, (some relevant portion also reproduced in the impugned order) which furnishes complete answer of such submission. The other submission of the learned counsel with reference to rule 3 of Order XLIX, C.P.C. which excludes the applicability of certain provisions of C.P.C. including Order VII, rules 10 an 11 (b) and (c) C.P.C. to the ordinary or extraordinary original civil jurisdiction of the High Court, is also equally without force, as non applicability of such provisions of C.P.C. do not deny or curtail the power of High Court either to reject or return the plaint in appropriate cases. If any case is needed to fortify this view reference can be made to the case of Mirza Abdul Rahim Baig (supra).\"\n  Learned counsel for the plaintiff has vehemently argued that for determining the fact that whether cause of action wholly or any part thereof has accrued to a. party within the territorial limits of a Court within the scope of section 20(c) C.P.C. the averments made in the plaint should be taken as whole and presumed to be correct. Admittedly that there being no cavil to this proposition that the averments of the plaint are to be read with the relief sought by a party in the suit in determining whether any or part of cause of action has accrued, but such reading of plaint should be meaningful and rationale to the controversy.\n  After hearing the arguments of both the counsel and going through the judgments as relied by them, I am of the view that this Court does not have territorial jurisdiction to hear this suit as the defendant is not residing or doing any business in Karachi. Prima facie the alleged agreement was not arrived at Karachi and neither any goods have been delivered to the defendant at Karachi, nor any payment was made at Karachi. The issuance of alleged notices to defendant and preparation of delivery/gate passes from the registered office of the plaintiff at Karachi cannot be considered as accrual of cause of action to the plaintiff within the territorial limits of this Court. In such circumstances, the listed application, filed by the defendant, is allowed and it is hereby ordered that the plaint should be returned to the plaintiff to be presented to the Court in which the suit should have been instituted. Accordingly C.M.A. No.6666 of 2006 stands disposed of.\n  M.H./A-163/K Plaint returned.",

The said judgment and decree was assailed in appeal, but the same was dismissed on 14-9-2009.\n  2. Facts leading to the filing of the suit have elaborately been set out in the judgment of the learned trial Court and may not be reproduced in extenso in this judgment. However, by way of a brief background the important facts are being given for appreciation of the background of the controversy. The parties are real brothers. They had migrated from India at the time of partition and were allotted property measuring 18 Acres in Sheikhupura. The property in question was sold in 1968 and the parties moved to Ali Pur Chattha. The respondent purchased House No.686/H at Ali Pur Chattha and started residing there. Apparently parties were living together till then. According to the case of the respondent House No.686/H proved to be inadequate for the two families. Therefore, the petitioner was allowed to move with his family to House No.859 situated at Ali Pur Chattha, which had been purchased by the respondent on 26-7-1974 through a duly registered sale-deed. There is divergence in the claims of the parties as to when the petitioner shifted to House No.859. While the petitioner claims that he has been in possession since 1980, the respondent's claim is that the house in question was given for temporary use to the petitioner about 10/12 years before filing of the suit. The respondent subsequently asked the petitioner to vacate House No.859 which request was refused. This led the respondent to file the aforesaid suit against the petitioner.\n  3. The defendant taken by the petitioner was that the house belonged to him because both the properties i.e. House No.686-H and House No.859 were purchased with the money received from the sale of the property in Sheikhupura. Although the property was in the name of the respondent, it was a Benami transaction because he was the real owner. He further took the stance that on account of a family settlement, it was agreed that House No.b86-H would be retained by the respondent and House No.859 would be given to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly took possession of the same. The petitioner alleges that the family settlement took place in 1980.\n  4. It has been argued on behalf of the petitioner that no independent witness was produced by the respondent before the trial Court in support of' his claim. He further submits that the witnesses produced by the petitioner as well as the respondent directly or indirectly admitted the fact of a family settlement. He further submits that while the learned subordinate Courts gave findings regarding the question of limitation and issue of the petitioner holding the property as a licensee, no issue was framed in this regard. He, therefore, submits that to such extent the findings of the learned subordinate Courts are illegal and are liable to be set aside. The learned counsel for the petitioner has also drawn my attention to the evidence of D. W.2 Riaz Hussain to argue that although he specifically stated that the family settlement had taken place in his presence, he was not specifically cross-examined on the point which had the consequence of admission of the said fact on the part of the respondent. It was further, pointed out that the respondent had not at any stage disclosed any source of income on the basis of which the property in question could have been acquired by them.\n  5. On the legal plane the learned counsel relied upon Shaukat Nawaz v. Mansab Dad and another 1988 SCMR 851, Jan Muhammad Khan v. Shah Mir Hussain and others 1985 SCMR 2029 and Nazir Ahmad and another v. M. Muzaffar Hussain 2008 SCMR 1639 to submit that concurrent findings of fact can be interfered with in exercise of revisional jurisdiction where there is misreading of evidence or the learned subordinate Courts have arrived at wrong conclusions on the basis of misreading of documents on record.\n  6. The learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand has pointed out that even according to the version of the petitioner, the joint property was sold in 1968. It is evident from the record that the suit property was purchased on 26-7-1974. He argued that there was nothing on record to show why the petitioner let the money stay with the respondent for six years without asking for it. It is further argued that the most important, material and pivotal question to support the defence of the petitioner was proof of family settlement. He submitted that the petitioner alleged a family settlement and based his claim on the suit property on such family settlement. Yet he did not appear in the witness box to testify about the same. He referred to Article 129 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 to assert that where the best evidence is withheld an adverse presumption can be drawn against a person withholding such evidence.\n  7. The learned counsel added that the plea of Benami transaction had no real basis. The petitioner neither alleged nor produced any original document relating to the suit property. As per requirement of proof of Benami transactions the petitioner did not produce any proof of having provided the funds which were used to purchase the aforesaid property. No explanation was given as to why he did not claim title documents of the property or his share of sale proceeds of Sheikhupura property. The learned counsel finally argued that the petitioner was in occupation of the suit property as licensee of the respondent and when he was asked to vacate the property, as an afterthought, he raised the plea of a family settlement after a lapse of 30 years. He finally submitted that duly registered sale-deed dated 26-7-1974 in favour of the respondent had not been challenged before any forum to date.\n  8. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length. The most material issues in the matter were Issues Nos.1 and 2. Onus to prove Issue No.1 was on the respondent and it related to the question whether the respondent was owner of the suit property and possession of the same by the petitioner was in the capacity of a licensee. The onus to prove Issue No.2 was on the petitioner, who was required to establish that he was actually owner of the suit property and the respondent was merely an ostensible owner of the same. I have perused the evidence produced by the parties with the assistance of the learned counsel for the parties. The respondent produced evidence to show that he had purchased the suit property from Imam Din on 26-7-1974. He got the property vacated from Mst. Ghafooran Bibi and had let the petitioner to use the same on temporary basis till such time that he constructed his own house. The said statement was supported by the documents including copy of registered sale-deed Exh.P.4, documents relating to ejectment petition Exh.P.5 to Exh.P.8 and Mark \"A\".\n  9. The petitioner was required to prove that the sale price of 18 Acres of land in Sheikhupura was retained by the respondent and that both the aforesaid properties including the suit property were purchased with the said funds. He was further required to establish that there was a family settlement through which House No.859 was by mutual consent given to the petitioner. A perusal of evidence shows that no affirmative evidence was produced by the petitioner in support of the aforesaid two propositions. Admittedly, the suit property is registered in the name of the respondent since 1974 and knowledge of this fact has nowhere been denied by the petitioner. There is no explanation forthcoming to the question why the petitioner kept quiet regarding his share in the sale proceeds of Sheikhupura property or the fact that the sale-deed had been registered in favour of the respondent. The fact that the sale-deed has not been challenged, also goes against the petitioner's stance, who has failed to challenge the validity of the sale-deed for about 35 years.\n  10. The learned counsel for the petitioner tried to find support from the evidence of D.W.1 relating to the fact of private partition on account of failure on the part of the respondent to cross-examine the witness on that issue. However, in my opinion the said omission is not enough to dislodge the case based upon documentary and affirmative evidence produced by the respondent in his favour. Further the petitioner did not succeed in substantiating his assertion that the whole amount relating to sale of agricultural land situated at Sheikhupura was received by the respondent and the same was utilized for the purchase of the suit property. Likewise the petitioner could not support this plea that the respondent had fraudulently got transferred the suit property in his name and that his title deed represented only Benami transaction. The petitioner was neither successful in proving that the funds used to purchase the suit property were provided by/belonged to him nor could he explain retention of title documents of the said property by the respondent without any challenge or protest of any nature against such retention on his part for about 35 years.\n  11. As far as the question of failure on the part of the trial Court to frame issue regarding questions of limitation, Behami transaction and family settlement are concerned, these do not vitiate the proceedings specially so where the petitioner all along had the opportunity to seek framing of additional issues. Such opportunity was never availed. This plea cannot in my opinion be raised at this belated stage under the facts and circumstances of the present case.\n  12. In view of the above discussion and on the basis of preponderance of oral and documentary evidence in favour of the respondent, I am not persuaded to interfere in the findings of the lower Courts. No misreading or non-reading of evidence has been demonstrated before me that could have materially affected the outcome of the suit. I find that there is no illegality or material irregularity in the findings of the learned subordinate Courts. Therefore, this petition fails and is accordingly dismissed.\n  S.A.K./A-348/L Revision dismissed.",

      "case_facts": " Facts leading to the filing of the suit have elaborately been set out in the judgment of the learned trial Court and may not be reproduced in extenso in this judgment. However, by way of a brief background the important facts are being given for appreciation of the background of the controversy. The parties are real brothers. They had migrated from India at the time of partition and were allotted property measuring 18 Acres in Sheikhupura. The property in question was sold in 1968 and the parties moved to Ali Pur Chattha. The respondent purchased House No.686/H at Ali Pur Chattha and started residing there. Apparently parties were living together till then. According to the case of the respondent House No.686/H proved to be inadequate for the two families. Therefore, the petitioner was allowed to move with his family to House No.859 situated at Ali Pur Chattha, which had been purchased by the respondent on 26-7-1974 through a duly registered sale-deed. There is divergence in the claims of the parties as to when the petitioner shifted to House No.859. While the petitioner claims that he has been in possession since 1980, the respondent's claim is that the house in question was given for temporary use to the petitioner about 10/12 years before filing of the suit.

A.-G., Sindh.\n    ORDER\n  AHMED ALI SHAIKH, J.-- Through this constitutional petition, the petitioners have prayed as under:---\n  (a) Set aside the impugned judgment dated 30-7-2007 passed by the Additional District Judge Sanghar in Civil Revision No.13 of 1999 (re: Gul Muhammad (deceased) through his L.Rs. v. Muhammad Umer and others) and maintain the order passed by the learned trial Court on 9-9-1999 on application under section 12(2), C.P.C. in F.C. Suit No.93 of 1998 (Re: Muhammad Umer v. Province of Sindh and others.).\n  (b) Cost of the suit may be saddled upon the respondents.\n  (c) Any other relief(s) which this honourable Court deems fit, just and proper in favour of the petitioners;\n  2. The facts leading to this petition are that on 19-11-1998 the petitioners had filed F.C. Suit No.93 of 1998 re: Muhammad Umar and another v. Province of Sindh and others for declaration and permanent injunction in respect of land bearing S.No.552 of abandoned Sarhal Wah and Khad as well as S.No.862 total area 13.03 Acres, situated in Deh Bantheri Taluka Khipro District Sanghar in the Court of Senior Civil Judge, Khipro stating therein that aforesaid land was granted to their father namely Fateh Ali son of Muhammad Siyal Hingorjo in the year 1935 by Colonization Officer Sukkur Barrage Hyderabad and Sanghar Barrage.\n  3. The grievance of the petitioners was that the defendants/ respondents Nos.2 and 3 in collusion with each other were issuing entitlement slips to various persons under Katchiabadi Scheme in Khipro Town; in respect of land of the petitioners.\n  4. The defendants in the said suit were properly served but they did not contest the suit, therefore, vide order dated 27-2-1999 their side was closed and ultimately suit of the petitioners was decreed vide Judgment and decree dated 16-4-1999 and 22-4-1999 respectively.\n  5. It is pertinent to mention here that in respect of same land, F.C. Suit No.16 of 1999 was filed by the respondent No.1 for declaration and permanent injunction during pendency of he petitioner's suit. The said suit of the respondent No.1 was dismissed by the trial Court due to his failure to produce the evidence, vide order dated 24-4-2002. Application for restoration of said suit filed by the respondent No.1 was also dismissed by the trial Court vide order dated 22-1-2004, which order was assailed before Additional District Judge Sanghar in Civil Appeal No.8 of 2004, which is still pending.\n  6. After judgment and decree passed in favour of the petitioners in F.C. Suit No.93 of 1998, the respondent No.1 filed an application under section 12(2) and C.P.C. and application under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. on 24-4-1999 and 6-5-1999 and 6-5-1999 respectively before the trial Court, which were rejected by the trial Court by a single order dated 9-9-1999.\n  7. From the pleadings, it appears that order dated 9-9-1999 was challenged by the respondent No.1 his legal heirs through Civil Revision No.13 of 1999. Vide order dated 30-7-2007, the learned Additional District Judge Sanghar allowed the Civil Revision and set aside the order dated 9-9-1999 passed by Senior Civil Judge Khipro in following terms:--\n  \"Considering the above facts and circumstances, let the matter be remanded to learned trial Court with the directions to dispose of the application of applicant Gul Muhammad filed on 6-5-1999 under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. thus the matter is remanded to trial Court with the directions to hear the parties and provide full opportunities to them, so that both sides may defend their rights. The Revision Application is allowed with no order as to costs. Order dated 9-9-1999 passed by Senior Civil Judge Khipro is set aside.\"\n  8. It is inter alia contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the impugned order has been passed against settled principles of law, facts and equity. The respondent No.1 moved such applications with ulterior motive and mala fide intention. They were aware about the pendency of the suit, during pendency of F.C. Suit No.93 of 1998, the respondent No.1 filed F.C. Suit No.16 of 1999 in respect of subject-matter of F.C. Suit No.93 of 1998 but after passing Judgment and Decree, the applications under section 12(2), C.P.C. and under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. were moved with sole object to linger on the matter for indefinite period as well as to defeat the judgment and decree passed by the competent Court of law. He further contended that the impugned order passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Sanghar is not maintainable and liable to be set aside.\n  9. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of Additional Advocate General Sindh conceded the above legal position that after disposal of the suit, an application for joining the parties in the suit cannot be entertained.\n  10. From the pleadings it appears that application under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. was filed after judgment and decree passed by the trial Court in favour of the petitioners. The respondent No.1 had also filed F.C. Suit No.16 of 1999 before the same Court in respect of same property but he did not move any application before the trial Court for joining him as defendant in F.C. Suit No.93 of 1998. The above conduct of the respondent No.1 reflects that the intentionally and deliberately remained mum and had waited for final decision in he suit, The impugned order passed by learned Additional District Judge Sanghar reflects that same has been passed in mechanical manner without taking into consideration the very important aspect of the case that the judgment and decree had been passed and suit was finally disposed of and the Court has become functus officio, therefore, remanding the case for hearing of the application by impugned order was uncalled for. Therefore, reason for remanding the case for hearing of the application under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. with erroneous and such an application could not be entertained by the trial Court after it has given judgment and decree.\n  11. The petition, for the aforesaid reasons, was allowed by our short order dated 12-11-2009.\n  M.U.Y./M-205/K Order accordingly.",

Suit No.93 of 1998, the respondent No.1 filed an application under section 12(2) and C.P.C. and application under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. on 24-4-1999 and 6-5-1999 and 6-5-1999 respectively before the trial Court, which were rejected by the trial Court by a single order dated 9-9-1999.\n  7. From the pleadings, it appears that order dated 9-9-1999 was challenged by the respondent No.1 his legal heirs through Civil Revision No.13 of 1999. Vide order dated 30-7-2007, the learned Additional District Judge Sanghar allowed the Civil Revision and set aside the order dated 9-9-1999 passed by Senior Civil Judge Khipro in following terms:--\n  \"Considering the above facts and circumstances, let the matter be remanded to learned trial Court with the directions to dispose of the application of applicant Gul Muhammad filed on 6-5-1999 under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. thus the matter is remanded to trial Court with the directions to hear the parties and provide full opportunities to them, so that both sides may defend their rights. The Revision Application is allowed with no order as to costs. Order dated 9-9-1999 passed by Senior Civil Judge Khipro is set aside.\"\n  8. It is inter alia contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the impugned order has been passed against settled principles of law, facts and equity. The respondent No.1 moved such applications with ulterior motive and mala fide intention. They were aware about the pendency of the suit, during pendency of F.C. Suit No.93 of 1998, the respondent No.1 filed F.C. Suit No.16 of 1999 in respect of subject-matter of F.C. Suit No.93 of 1998 but after passing Judgment and Decree, the applications under section 12(2), C.P.C. and under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. were moved with sole object to linger on the matter for indefinite period as well as to defeat the judgment and decree passed by the competent Court of law. He further contended that the impugned order passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Sanghar is not maintainable and liable to be set aside.\n  9. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of Additional Advocate General Sindh conceded the above legal position that after disposal of the suit, an application for joining the parties in the suit cannot be entertained.\n  10. From the pleadings it appears that application under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. was filed after judgment and decree passed by the trial Court in favour of the petitioners. The respondent No.1 had also filed F.C. Suit No.16 of 1999 before the same Court in respect of same property but he did not move any application before the trial Court for joining him as defendant in F.C. Suit No.93 of 1998. The above conduct of the respondent No.1 reflects that the intentionally and deliberately remained mum and had waited for final decision in he suit, The impugned order passed by learned Additional District Judge Sanghar reflects that same has been passed in mechanical manner without taking into consideration the very important aspect of the case that the judgment and decree had been passed and suit was finally disposed of and the Court has become functus officio, therefore, remanding the case for hearing of the application by impugned order was uncalled for. Therefore, reason for remanding the case for hearing of the application under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. with erroneous and such an application could not be entertained by the trial Court after it has given judgment and decree.",

Briefly stated the facts of the case are that petitioner/plaintiff filed civil suit for declaration claiming him to be lawful owner in possession of suit-land measuring 56 Kanals, 8 Marlas falling in Khata No.71 of Mutation No.718 situated at Mauza Pehar, Tehsil Taunsa Sharif through which land measuring 20 Kanals were transferred in the name of defendants/respondents Nos.1 and 2 in civil suit the petitioner/plaintiff challenged Mutation No.718 dated 20-3-2000 which was sanctioned in favour of respondents/defendants Nos.1 and 2 being based on fraud, collusion, illegal without payment of sale price, having no legal effect on his rights, liable to be cancelled.

However, respondent No.3 was proceeded against ex parte.\n  3. After framing of issues and recording of evidence of both the parties the learned trial Court dismissed the suit of the petitioner.

The balance sale consideration was payable at the time of execution of sale-deed. It is also the case of the applicant that time and again he called upon Aftab Ahmed Sheikh to complete the transaction but he failed to do so though the applicant was always ready and willing to complete his part of the transaction. The applicant also claims that over the years he made the barren and saline land cultivable by incurring expenditure. It is also the case of. the applicant that in 1993 one Illahi Bux Mugheri claiming to be owner of Survey number 694 called upon the applicant to hand over its possession to him and threatened that in case the applicant fails to do so then he would forcibly dispossess the applicant.\n  2. The applicant then obtained certified copies from the Revenue Record and Sub-Registrar which revealed that on the basis of power of attorney from his three sisters. Aftab Ahmed Sheikh sold 50 Paisa shares in Survey numbers 564, 568, 665, 693 and 694, through registered sale-deed dated 10-3-1984 to one Akbar Arain and the remaining 50 paisa share in the said Survey numbers to Illahi Bux Mugheri vide registered sale-deed dated 29-9-1986. Akbar Arain then sold his 50 paisa share to Illahi Bux Mugheri thereby the entire 100 Paisa share in Survey numbers 564, 568, 665, 693 and 694 stood transferred to Illahi Bux Mugheri. It has also come on record that in 1990 Aftab Ahmed Sheikh also sold Survey numbers 686, 692 and 695 to one Nisar Ahmed through a registered sale-deed. When the transaction of 1982 claimed by the applicant is compared with the above stated sale transactions of 1984, 1986 and 1990 in favour of Illahi Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arian and Nisar Ahmed, two Survey numbers 694 and 695 comprising of 07 Acres and 38 Ghuntas become disputed between the applicant on one hand and Illahi, Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arian and Nisar Ahmed on the other.\n  3. Threatened with dispossession the applicant then filed Suit No.132 of 1993 for specific performance of contract and permanent injunction against all the subsequent purchasers of Survey numbers 694 and 695 as well as the original owners with whom he entered into agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982.\n  4. Soon after the applicant filed suit in 1993, Illahi Bux Mugheri also filed Suit No.139 of 1993 seeking permanent injunction in relation to Survey number 694 on the strength of the sale-deeds executed in his favour by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh in 1984 and Akbar Arian in 1990. The case of Illahi Bux Mugheri in his suit was that the boundaries of Survey number 694 overlapped with the survey numbers of the applicant and therefore, he first sought demarcation from the Mukhtiarkar but the applicant prevented the Revenue functionary from doing so then the matter was referred to notables of the area, who held that Illahi Bux Mugheri was entitled to occupy Survey number 694 but as the applicant did not honour the decision of the notables he was constrained to file his suit.\n  5. Aftab Ahmed Sheikh, who is said to have entered into multiple deals with two parties of the same Survey numbers i.e. 694 and 695 which gave birth to controversies involved in both the suits, in his written statement filed in Suit No.132 of 1993 described the agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 to be a forged document and denied applicant's possession. Aftab Ahmed Sheikh maintained that he had sold 50 Paisa share in Survey number 694 to Illahi Bux Mugheri in 1984 and the remaining 50 Paisa share to Akbar Arian in 1986 and Survey number 695 was sold by him to Nisar Ahmed in 1990.\n  6. In their depositions, the applicant and his witnesses have stated that the applicant is in possession of Survey numbers 694, 695, 696, 708, 707, 706, 709,710, 691, 711, 726, 725 and 724 on the basis of agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 and has been paying land revenue for the same. On the other hand Illahi Bux Mugheri who claims to be owner of Survey number 694 has neither claimed that he has been paying land revenue for Survey number 694 nor he has taken the plea that applicant has forcibly dispossessed him from Survey' number 694 at any particular point in time. His case only was that there was overlapping of the boundaries of Survey number 694 with the applicant's land and the same should be demarcated. Aftab Ahmed Sheikh who executed sale-deeds in favour of Illahi Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arain and Nisar Ahmed, though has disputed the agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 as forged but he too has not taken any plea in his written statement to demonstrate as to how, when and in what manner the Survey numbers 694 and 695 along with remaining eleven Survey numbers i.e. Survey numbers 696, 708, 707, 706, 709, 710, 691, 711, 726, 725 and 724 came in possession of the applicant. Absence of such a plea at least show that disputed Survey numbers 694 and 695 came under the occupation of the applicant along with other eleven Survey numbers which are part of the 1982 sale transaction said to be entered into by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh with the applicant.\n  7. Aftab Ahmed Sheikh in his capacity. as attorney of his three sisters or even the sisters directly have also not initiated any legal proceedings of their own to seek back possession of the other eleven Survey numbers i.e. 696, 708, 707, 706, 709, 710, 691, 711, 726, 725, which the applicant claimed to have also sold to him under agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 and are in his possession since 1982.\n  8. The Courts have to confine their decisions to the real controversy involved in a case. The applicant has categorically and unequivocally claimed the possession of 44 Acres comprising of Survey numbers 696, 708, 707, 706, 709, 710, 691, 711, 726, 725 and 724 on the basis of agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 of which two Survey numbers i.e. 694 and 695 are being claimed by Illahi Bux Mugheri and Nisar Ahmed and it was the dispute of these two Survey numbers only which triggered the legal battle between the parties. Like Aftab. Ahmed Sheikh, Nisar Ahmed in whose name Survey number 695 was registered has also not initiated any legal proceedings of his own against the applicant with regard to Survey number 695. Only Illahi Bux Mugheri has filed Suit No.139 of 1993 claiming that Survey number 694 was purchased by him in 1984 and 1986 and he is its owner. Furthermore, Aftab Ahmed Sheikh, Illahi Bux Mugheri and Nisar Ahmed- have nowhere in their pleadings taken the plea that applicant has forcibly occupied the disputed lands at any particular point in time. Whereas the applicant has established in evidence that he has been cultivating the disputed land since 1982 and paying land revenue for the same. Mere general and vague pleas denying possession of the applicant on the disputed land is not sufficient to brush aside applicant's claim that he is in possession of the land since 1982. Had Illahi Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arain and Nisar Ahmed been physically put in possession of Survey number 694 and 695 in the years 1984, 1986 and 1990, when the sale-deeds were executed by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh in their favour then why they have-not pleaded dispossession at the hands of the applicant at any given point in time thereafter. If the physical possession was not given to them then this in itself means that possession of these two numbers was already with the applicant when sale-deeds were executed by Aftab Ahmed in 1984, 1986 and 1990 in favour of Illahi Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arain and Nisar Ahmed. Hence this leaves no other alternative with this Court but to believe that applicant came in possession of 44 Acres of land in 1982 and till the filing of the suits in 1993 no one had challenged applicant's possession.\n  9. The questions that need to be answered in the light of above discussed facts are (i) whether the agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 is a forged document and if not then who is to be declared to be the lawful owner of the disputed land. One of the reasons which prevailed with the appellate Court for not believing the authenticity of agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 was that the attesting witnesses were not examined by the applicant to prove genuineness of the transaction. Such a finding of the appellate Court is contrary to the evidence on record. It has come on record that one of the two attesting witnesses namely Ali Haider Khan was examined and his deposition is marked as Exhibit 107 and the other could not be produced as he was in Saudi Arabia. The examining of one attesting witness in such circumstances was sufficient to establish execution of the sale agreement dated 4-3-1982. No credence could be lent to Aftab Ahmed Sheikh's plea that the agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 is forged when he neither got the document referred to a handwriting expert for his opinion nor he took the plea as to how, in what manner and at what point in time the applicant came in possession of 44 Acres of land. With regard to applicant's: claim that he is in possession of 44 Acres since 1982, no question was put to him in his cross-examination to the effect that the applicant at particular point in time had forcibly occupied the 44 Acres of land. Thus applicant's possession of 44 Acres of land since 1982 stood established as his plea that he is cultivating the disputed, land since 1982 and paying land revenue for the same remained unshaken in evidence. The following statements of the applicant in his examination-in-chief are relevant:--\n  From the Examination-in-chief of the applicant in Suit No.135 of 1993 that was held on 21-11-2002.\n  \"---Since the date of agreement I continue in the possession and enjoyment of the suit-land on the site. I pay its land revenue assessments. My Haris Khuda Dost, Abdul Razak, Deedar, Muhammad Hassan, and others are my Haris on suit-land. Today I have brought my Hari Khuda Dost; he is my Hari in Serial Nos.694 and 695. The suit-land in situated in Deh Aacha Taluka Kambar. I have not brought the attesting witness Gul Hassan because at present he is in Saudi Arabia, but I have brought the attesting witness Ali Hyder. The ascribe Abdul Sattar have died since about last five years. I have examined P.W. Abdul Waheed who is son of ascribe Abdul Sattar. Subsequently Aftab has sold suit-land to Illahi Bux and Akbar, and also to the Nisar Ahmed\".\n  From the examination-in-Chief of the applicant that was held on 28-11-2002\n  \"I came to know about the impugned sale of Serial No.694 and 695, made by Aftab Ahmed in favour of plaintiff Haji Illahi Bux in Suit No.139 of 1993, and defendants Nisar Ahmed and Akbar Khan in Suit No.132 of 1993. About two months prior to the filing of the F.C. Suit No.132 of 1993 they also threatened me to hand over possession of the above-referred S.Nos. to them otherwise I would be forcibly dispossessed there-from. The defendant No.3 Akbar Khan in F.C. Suit No.132 of 1993, had sold away his share in the above referred (Survey number) to Nisar Ahmed and Haji Illahi Bux under the above referred impugn sale-deed. Thereafter, I obtained the true copies of impugn registered sale-deed produced as Ex.102 to 105, and filed the F.C. Suit No.132 of 1993, against them. The impugned sale made through the above referred registered sale-deed to the above named vandees are illegal and mala fide. They were in the full knowledge of my agreement as Exh.98, and also about my possession on the site of the above referred land. The Suit No.139/1993, filed by them with regard aforesaid' Survey numbers is based upon false facts because the plaintiff in that suit is not in possession of the said land. I still apprehend of my forcibly dispossession from the land in question by Nisar Ahmed, Haji Illahi Bux and Akbar Khan through the official defendants in my suit, I therefore, pray to decree my suit as prayed for and dismiss the suit of the plaintiff. I have always been ready and willing to pay the balance of price of the suit-land and have been approaching Aftab Ahmed to receive the balance and execute the registered sale-deed but he used to place me on false hopes. I am still prepared to pay the balance under the agreement as Ex.98. I had also asked the defendants who are subsequent purchasers to execute me sale-deed but they also refused. I have brought Ali Hyder the attesting witness of Exh.98, and Khuda Dost one of the Haris in the suit-land and Ali Gul the neighboring Khatedar of Deh in which the suit-land is situated.\"\n  10. The above quoted statements of the applicant under oath that he made in his examination-in-chief were not shaken in his cross-examination hence are to be accepted as true.\n  11. The claim of the subsequent purchasers i.e. Illahi Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arain and Nisar Ahmed that they were put in possession of Survey numbers 694 and 695 by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh at the time of sale transactions with him in 1984, 1986 and 1990 has not been established. When they claim that they were put in possession of Survey numbers 694 and 695 but total absence of any plea on their part that the applicant has forcibly dispossessed them at any stage after execution of sale-deeds in their favour belie their claim that they were put in possession of Survey numbers 694 and 695. This further strengthens applicant's claim that he was in possession of the said Survey numbers since 1982 and this could only be on the basis of agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 as Aftab Ahmed Sheikh has also not pleaded dispossession against the applicant.\n  12. Next question that needs to be examined is what is the legal status of applicant's possession under an agreement to sell section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act grants statutory recognition to transferee's possession which he acquires under an agreement to sell in part performance of a contract. Therefore, when a purchaser of a land under an agreement to sell is put in possession in part performance of the contract, then he becomes entitled to the protection of section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act. It is nobody's case that possession of 44 Acres was forcibly taken over by the applicant. The applicant has established that he was put in possession pursuant to agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 and Illahi Bax Mugheri just used the tool of getting Survey number 694 demarcated in order to get its possession on the strength of the sale-deed that was executed in his favour. This relief which Illahi Bux Mugheri was seeking in relation to Survey number 694 when it was already part of the sale transaction dated 4-3-1982 entered into by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh with the applicant. Thus second transfer of Survey number 694 in 1984/1986 by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh when it was already agreed to be sold by him to the applicant under agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 was of no legal consequence. No doubt that applicant holds only an agreement to sell for Survey numbers 694 and 695 but the possession of these Survey numbers along with eleven other Survey numbers was also handed over to him in 1982 under the agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 whereas transfer of Survey numbers 694 and 695 through registered sale-deed in favour of Illahi Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arain and Nisar Ahmed in the years 1984, 1986 and 1990 are all subsequent to the execution of agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982. After execution of agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 and handing over of possession of disputed land pursuant thereto to the applicant made Aftab Ahmed Shaikh legally incompetent to sell or transfer in any manner Survey numbers 694 and 695 to any one.\n  13. The law does not entitle a person to transfer a right in a property which he himself does not possess though the property may be in his name. As Survey numbers 694 and 695 had already been agreed to be sold under an agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 which was coupled with transfer of possession, the subsequent transferees cannot be conferred with any lawful title in the disputed land. The subsequent transferees cannot even claim to be bona fide purchasers for value without notice for the simple reason that when Survey numbers 694 and 695 were transferred in their favour, the applicant was already in possession of the same and the subsequent transferees did not approach the applicant to ask him about the nature or basis of his possession. Hence subsequent transfers being not bona fide are not legally valid transfers.\n  14. Section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act in itself creates a right in favour of a transferee to retain possession. Such right comes into existence when transferor puts the transferee in possession in part performance of the contract. The right created by section 53-A in favour of the transferee in possession could be termed as an equitable title which he holds in the property. Hence where a transferee is enjoying possession of a property pursuant to an agreement to sell and such right is threatened by the transferor or a person claiming under him or even by a stranger then the transferee becomes entitled to defend his existing right in a Court of law. While defending so it matters not whether he goes to the Court as a plaintiff or is sued as a defendant. Normally suit is filed against the transferee in possession either by the transferor or a person claiming under him which threatens the transferee his enjoyment of possession. Faced with such a situation, the transferee in possession defends his possession by virtue of section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. However, there can be a situation, where instead of transferor or a person claiming under him files a suit against the transferee in possession, the transferor or a person claiming under him creates such a situation which threatens the transferee his possession and compels him to seek protection of the Court. In such a situation, the transferee brings his own suit against the transferor or the person claiming under the transferor in order to defend his right to retain his possession. Even as a plaintiff, the relief that is sought by a transferee in possession from the Court under section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act is perseverance of his possession of the property. Thus in both the positions i.e. plaintiff or defendant, the transferee in possession is defending his equitable title that he has already acquired in the property under his possession by virtue of section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act. Why a transferee in possession should wait for an action to be brought against him by the transferor or any person claiming under the transferor or a stranger to exercise his right to retain possession under section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act. Why not the transferee in possession when threatened should himself establish in a Court of law the legality of his possession by filing his own suit. If the right to seek protection under section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act is construed to be only available to a transferee if he is sued as a defendant in a suit then it would create an anomalous situation. It would then mean that it is the capacity in which a transferee in possession finds himself in a suit i.e. as a plaintiff or a defendant, which would determine whether the protection under section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act is to be extended to him. This does not appeal to reason. The right conferred upon a transferee in possession under section 53-A should not depend upon how he is described in a suit i.e. plaintiff or a defendant. This cannot be the object of the lawmakers. Statutory protection granted under section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act is available to a transferee in possession and it matters not whether he is a plaintiff or a defendant in a suit. His status as a plaintiff or defendant in a suit will be of no legal consequence while deciding his entitlement under section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act. In any of the two capacities, the transferee in possession is defending his right to retain possession, which he is already enjoying. When the transferee files his suit, he is doing nothing but defending his existing right of possession, which he is already enjoying by virtue of section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. The right of a transferee in possession granted under section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act can be availed by him whether he files his own suit or is sued as defendant. Therefore, a transferee in possession can always file suit of his own seeking the relief of permanent injunction in order to preserve his equitable title i.e. the right to enjoy possession of the property in the wake of any threat either from the transferor or any person claiming under him or even a stranger. Reliance is placed on the case of Ahmed Mujtaba Khan versus Iqbal Shah reported in 1990 CLC 1381 and a Division Bench case of Inayat Ullah v. Shah Muhammad reported in PLD 1961 Lah. 372 where it has been held that a transferee of immovable property can defend his right guaranteed to him under Section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act, whether he defends this right in his capacity as a plaintiff or a defendant.\n  15. It may also be mentioned here that though for filing a suit for specific performance of a contract, the prescribed period of limitation is three years but as the applicant has filed his suit on the basis of agreement to sell which is coupled with transfer of possession and has also sought the relief of, permanent injunction, the statute of limitation would not come in his way. Where a plaintiff continue to enjoy a right then the statute of limitation cannot take away such a right as the law of limitation is not meant to take away an existing right. It only bars remedy to gain one's lost right. The right created under section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act is an existing right and is not extinguished by any length of time. There cannot be any expiry date for enjoyment of a right conferred upon a transferee in possession under section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. Therefore, the law of limitation does not come in the way of a transferee in possession when he as a plaintiff, files his own suit to preserve his right to retain possession that is granted to him under Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act.\n  16. It may also be added here that while granting the relief of permanent injunction to transferee in possession under Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act, the Court may also direct the parties to complete the transaction under the agreement to sell. This would certainly close doors to future litigation and would also perfect the equitable title of the transferee in possession. There is no reason to deny this to the transferee in possession when it was the transferor who in the first place failed to discharge his obligation under the contract. It may be made clear that in case the transferee in possession does not perform his remaining obligation under the contract even after getting decree from the Court, then he would loose the protection and the relief granted to him under the decree shall stand recalled as he would come out of the ambit of the protection which section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act extends to a transferee in possession. On the other hand in case the transferor fails to perform his remaining obligation then the Court would get it done through its functionary, which is the normal course adopted by Courts to take the contractual obligation 'to its logical conclusion.\n  17. From the above discussion it is evident that both the Courts below committed error of misreading and non-reading of evidence on record and also did not appreciate the implication of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. The civil controversies are decided on the basis of preponderance of probabilities. Overwhelming evidence has come on record to believe the case of the applicant as his pleas with regard to his possession under the agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 and his readiness and willingness to perform his obligation thereunder remained unshaken in evidence. Hence the impugned judgments are set aside, the Suit No.132 of 1993 filed by the applicant is decreed and the Suit No.139 of 1993 filed by Illahi Bux Mugheri is dismissed. The sale-deeds executed by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh in relation to Survey numbers 694 and 695 being based on transactions subsequent to the transaction with the applicant have no legal validity.\n  18. In view of the above findings, the applicant is directed to deposit the balance sale consideration payable under the agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 with the trial Court within 30 days and upon such deposit, the applicant shall become entitled to get Survey numbers 694, 695, 696, 708, 707, 709, 710, 691, 711,726, 725 and 724 comprising of about 44 Acres of agricultural lands in Deh Acha, Taluka Kamber transferred in his name either directly from the owners or in case they fail to do so within 30 days of the deposit of balance sale consideration by the applicant then the Nazir or any other officer nominated by the trial Court shall execute the sale-deed in favour of the applicant.\n  19. Both these Civil Revision Applications are allowed in the above terms.\n  M.H./M-209/K Order accordingly.",

The balance sale consideration was payable at the time of execution of sale-deed. It is also the case of the applicant that time and again he called upon Aftab Ahmed Sheikh to complete the transaction but he failed to do so though the applicant was always ready and willing to complete his part of the transaction. The applicant also claims that over the years he made the barren and saline land cultivable by incurring expenditure. It is also the case of. the applicant that in 1993 one Illahi Bux Mugheri claiming to be owner of Survey number 694 called upon the applicant to hand over its possession to him and threatened that in case the applicant fails to do so then he would forcibly dispossess the applicant.\n ",

      "case_proceddings": "The applicant then obtained certified copies from the Revenue Record and Sub-Registrar which revealed that on the basis of power of attorney from his three sisters. Aftab Ahmed Sheikh sold 50 Paisa shares in Survey numbers 564, 568, 665, 693 and 694, through registered sale-deed dated 10-3-1984 to one Akbar Arain and the remaining 50 paisa share in the said Survey numbers to Illahi Bux Mugheri vide registered sale-deed dated 29-9-1986. Akbar Arain then sold his 50 paisa share to Illahi Bux Mugheri thereby the entire 100 Paisa share in Survey numbers 564, 568, 665, 693 and 694 stood transferred to Illahi Bux Mugheri. It has also come on record that in 1990 Aftab Ahmed Sheikh also sold Survey numbers 686, 692 and 695 to one Nisar Ahmed through a registered sale-deed. When the transaction of 1982 claimed by the applicant is compared with the above stated sale transactions of 1984, 1986 and 1990 in favour of Illahi Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arian and Nisar Ahmed, two Survey numbers 694 and 695 comprising of 07 Acres and 38 Ghuntas become disputed between the applicant on one hand and Illahi, Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arian and Nisar Ahmed on the other.\n  3. Threatened with dispossession the applicant then filed Suit No.132 of 1993 for specific performance of contract and permanent injunction against all the subsequent purchasers of Survey numbers 694 and 695 as well as the original owners with whom he entered into agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982.\n  4. Soon after the applicant filed suit in 1993, Illahi Bux Mugheri also filed Suit No.139 of 1993 seeking permanent injunction in relation to Survey number 694 on the strength of the sale-deeds executed in his favour by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh in 1984 and Akbar Arian in 1990. The case of Illahi Bux Mugheri in his suit was that the boundaries of Survey number 694 overlapped with the survey numbers of the applicant and therefore, he first sought demarcation from the Mukhtiarkar but the applicant prevented the Revenue functionary from doing so then the matter was referred to notables of the area, who held that Illahi Bux Mugheri was entitled to occupy Survey number 694 but as the applicant did not honour the decision of the notables he was constrained to file his suit.\n  5. Aftab Ahmed Sheikh, who is said to have entered into multiple deals with two parties of the same Survey numbers i.e. 694 and 695 which gave birth to controversies involved in both the suits, in his written statement filed in Suit No.132 of 1993 described the agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 to be a forged document and denied applicant's possession. Aftab Ahmed Sheikh maintained that he had sold 50 Paisa share in Survey number 694 to Illahi Bux Mugheri in 1984 and the remaining 50 Paisa share to Akbar Arian in 1986 and Survey number 695 was sold by him to Nisar Ahmed in 1990.\n  6. In their depositions, the applicant and his witnesses have stated that the applicant is in possession of Survey numbers 694, 695, 696, 708, 707, 706, 709,710, 691, 711, 726, 725 and 724 on the basis of agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 and has been paying land revenue for the same. On the other hand Illahi Bux Mugheri who claims to be owner of Survey number 694 has neither claimed that he has been paying land revenue for Survey number 694 nor he has taken the plea that applicant has forcibly dispossessed him from Survey' number 694 at any particular point in time. His case only was that there was overlapping of the boundaries of Survey number 694 with the applicant's land and the same should be demarcated. Aftab Ahmed Sheikh who executed sale-deeds in favour of Illahi Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arain and Nisar Ahmed, though has disputed the agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 as forged but he too has not taken any plea in his written statement to demonstrate as to how, when and in what manner the Survey numbers 694 and 695 along with remaining eleven Survey numbers i.e. Survey numbers 696, 708, 707, 706, 709, 710, 691, 711, 726, 725 and 724 came in possession of the applicant. Absence of such a plea at least show that disputed Survey numbers 694 and 695 came under the occupation of the applicant along with other eleven Survey numbers which are part of the 1982 sale transaction said to be entered into by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh with the applicant.\n  7. Aftab Ahmed Sheikh in his capacity. as attorney of his three sisters or even the sisters directly have also not initiated any legal proceedings of their own to seek back possession of the other eleven Survey numbers i.e. 696, 708, 707, 706, 709, 710, 691, 711, 726, 725, which the applicant claimed to have also sold to him under agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 and are in his possession since 1982.\n  8. The Courts have to confine their decisions to the real controversy involved in a case. The applicant has categorically and unequivocally claimed the possession of 44 Acres comprising of Survey numbers 696, 708, 707, 706, 709, 710, 691, 711, 726, 725 and 724 on the basis of agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 of which two Survey numbers i.e. 694 and 695 are being claimed by Illahi Bux Mugheri and Nisar Ahmed and it was the dispute of these two Survey numbers only which triggered the legal battle between the parties. Like Aftab. Ahmed Sheikh, Nisar Ahmed in whose name Survey number 695 was registered has also not initiated any legal proceedings of his own against the applicant with regard to Survey number 695. Only Illahi Bux Mugheri has filed Suit No.139 of 1993 claiming that Survey number 694 was purchased by him in 1984 and 1986 and he is its owner. Furthermore, Aftab Ahmed Sheikh, Illahi Bux Mugheri and Nisar Ahmed- have nowhere in their pleadings taken the plea that applicant has forcibly occupied the disputed lands at any particular point in time. Whereas the applicant has established in evidence that he has been cultivating the disputed land since 1982 and paying land revenue for the same. Mere general and vague pleas denying possession of the applicant on the disputed land is not sufficient to brush aside applicant's claim that he is in possession of the land since 1982. Had Illahi Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arain and Nisar Ahmed been physically put in possession of Survey number 694 and 695 in the years 1984, 1986 and 1990, when the sale-deeds were executed by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh in their favour then why they have-not pleaded dispossession at the hands of the applicant at any given point in time thereafter. If the physical possession was not given to them then this in itself means that possession of these two numbers was already with the applicant when sale-deeds were executed by Aftab Ahmed in 1984, 1986 and 1990 in favour of Illahi Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arain and Nisar Ahmed. Hence this leaves no other alternative with this Court but to believe that applicant came in possession of 44 Acres of land in 1982 and till the filing of the suits in 1993 no one had challenged applicant's possession.\n  9. The questions that need to be answered in the light of above discussed facts are (i) whether the agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 is a forged document and if not then who is to be declared to be the lawful owner of the disputed land. One of the reasons which prevailed with the appellate Court for not believing the authenticity of agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 was that the attesting witnesses were not examined by the applicant to prove genuineness of the transaction. Such a finding of the appellate Court is contrary to the evidence on record. It has come on record that one of the two attesting witnesses namely Ali Haider Khan was examined and his deposition is marked as Exhibit 107 and the other could not be produced as he was in Saudi Arabia. The examining of one attesting witness in such circumstances was sufficient to establish execution of the sale agreement dated 4-3-1982. No credence could be lent to Aftab Ahmed Sheikh's plea that the agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 is forged when he neither got the document referred to a handwriting expert for his opinion nor he took the plea as to how, in what manner and at what point in time the applicant came in possession of 44 Acres of land. With regard to applicant's: claim that he is in possession of 44 Acres since 1982, no question was put to him in his cross-examination to the effect that the applicant at particular point in time had forcibly occupied the 44 Acres of land. Thus applicant's possession of 44 Acres of land since 1982 stood established as his plea that he is cultivating the disputed, land since 1982 and paying land revenue for the same remained unshaken in evidence. The following statements of the applicant in his examination-in-chief are relevant:--\n  From the Examination-in-chief of the applicant in Suit No.135 of 1993 that was held on 21-11-2002.\n  \"---Since the date of agreement I continue in the possession and enjoyment of the suit-land on the site. I pay its land revenue assessments. My Haris Khuda Dost, Abdul Razak, Deedar, Muhammad Hassan, and others are my Haris on suit-land. Today I have brought my Hari Khuda Dost; he is my Hari in Serial Nos.694 and 695. The suit-land in situated in Deh Aacha Taluka Kambar. I have not brought the attesting witness Gul Hassan because at present he is in Saudi Arabia, but I have brought the attesting witness Ali Hyder. The ascribe Abdul Sattar have died since about last five years. I have examined P.W. Abdul Waheed who is son of ascribe Abdul Sattar. Subsequently Aftab has sold suit-land to Illahi Bux and Akbar, and also to the Nisar Ahmed\".\n  From the examination-in-Chief of the applicant that was held on 28-11-2002\n  \"I came to know about the impugned sale of Serial No.694 and 695, made by Aftab Ahmed in favour of plaintiff Haji Illahi Bux in Suit No.139 of 1993, and defendants Nisar Ahmed and Akbar Khan in Suit No.132 of 1993. About two months prior to the filing of the F.C. Suit No.132 of 1993 they also threatened me to hand over possession of the above-referred S.Nos. to them otherwise I would be forcibly dispossessed there-from. The defendant No.3 Akbar Khan in F.C. Suit No.132 of 1993, had sold away his share in the above referred (Survey number) to Nisar Ahmed and Haji Illahi Bux under the above referred impugn sale-deed. Thereafter, I obtained the true copies of impugn registered sale-deed produced as Ex.102 to 105, and filed the F.C. Suit No.132 of 1993, against them. The impugned sale made through the above referred registered sale-deed to the above named vandees are illegal and mala fide. They were in the full knowledge of my agreement as Exh.98, and also about my possession on the site of the above referred land. The Suit No.139/1993, filed by them with regard aforesaid' Survey numbers is based upon false facts because the plaintiff in that suit is not in possession of the said land. I still apprehend of my forcibly dispossession from the land in question by Nisar Ahmed, Haji Illahi Bux and Akbar Khan through the official defendants in my suit, I therefore, pray to decree my suit as prayed for and dismiss the suit of the plaintiff. I have always been ready and willing to pay the balance of price of the suit-land and have been approaching Aftab Ahmed to receive the balance and execute the registered sale-deed but he used to place me on false hopes. I am still prepared to pay the balance under the agreement as Ex.98. I had also asked the defendants who are subsequent purchasers to execute me sale-deed but they also refused. I have brought Ali Hyder the attesting witness of Exh.98, and Khuda Dost one of the Haris in the suit-land and Ali Gul the neighboring Khatedar of Deh in which the suit-land is situated.\"\n  10. The above quoted statements of the applicant under oath that he made in his examination-in-chief were not shaken in his cross-examination hence are to be accepted as true.\n  11. The claim of the subsequent purchasers i.e. Illahi Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arain and Nisar Ahmed that they were put in possession of Survey numbers 694 and 695 by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh at the time of sale transactions with him in 1984, 1986 and 1990 has not been established. When they claim that they were put in possession of Survey numbers 694 and 695 but total absence of any plea on their part that the applicant has forcibly dispossessed them at any stage after execution of sale-deeds in their favour belie their claim that they were put in possession of Survey numbers 694 and 695. This further strengthens applicant's claim that he was in possession of the said Survey numbers since 1982 and this could only be on the basis of agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 as Aftab Ahmed Sheikh has also not pleaded dispossession against the applicant.\n  12. Next question that needs to be examined is what is the legal status of applicant's possession under an agreement to sell section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act grants statutory recognition to transferee's possession which he acquires under an agreement to sell in part performance of a contract. Therefore, when a purchaser of a land under an agreement to sell is put in possession in part performance of the contract, then he becomes entitled to the protection of section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act. It is nobody's case that possession of 44 Acres was forcibly taken over by the applicant. The applicant has established that he was put in possession pursuant to agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 and Illahi Bax Mugheri just used the tool of getting Survey number 694 demarcated in order to get its possession on the strength of the sale-deed that was executed in his favour. This relief which Illahi Bux Mugheri was seeking in relation to Survey number 694 when it was already part of the sale transaction dated 4-3-1982 entered into by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh with the applicant. Thus second transfer of Survey number 694 in 1984/1986 by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh when it was already agreed to be sold by him to the applicant under agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 was of no legal consequence. No doubt that applicant holds only an agreement to sell for Survey numbers 694 and 695 but the possession of these Survey numbers along with eleven other Survey numbers was also handed over to him in 1982 under the agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 whereas transfer of Survey numbers 694 and 695 through registered sale-deed in favour of Illahi Bux Mugheri, Akbar Arain and Nisar Ahmed in the years 1984, 1986 and 1990 are all subsequent to the execution of agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982. After execution of agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 and handing over of possession of disputed land pursuant thereto to the applicant made Aftab Ahmed Shaikh legally incompetent to sell or transfer in any manner Survey numbers 694 and 695 to any one.\n  13. The law does not entitle a person to transfer a right in a property which he himself does not possess though the property may be in his name. As Survey numbers 694 and 695 had already been agreed to be sold under an agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 which was coupled with transfer of possession, the subsequent transferees cannot be conferred with any lawful title in the disputed land. The subsequent transferees cannot even claim to be bona fide purchasers for value without notice for the simple reason that when Survey numbers 694 and 695 were transferred in their favour, the applicant was already in possession of the same and the subsequent transferees did not approach the applicant to ask him about the nature or basis of his possession. Hence subsequent transfers being not bona fide are not legally valid transfers.\n  14. Section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act in itself creates a right in favour of a transferee to retain possession. Such right comes into existence when transferor puts the transferee in possession in part performance of the contract. The right created by section 53-A in favour of the transferee in possession could be termed as an equitable title which he holds in the property. Hence where a transferee is enjoying possession of a property pursuant to an agreement to sell and such right is threatened by the transferor or a person claiming under him or even by a stranger then the transferee becomes entitled to defend his existing right in a Court of law. While defending so it matters not whether he goes to the Court as a plaintiff or is sued as a defendant. Normally suit is filed against the transferee in possession either by the transferor or a person claiming under him which threatens the transferee his enjoyment of possession. Faced with such a situation, the transferee in possession defends his possession by virtue of section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. However, there can be a situation, where instead of transferor or a person claiming under him files a suit against the transferee in possession, the transferor or a person claiming under him creates such a situation which threatens the transferee his possession and compels him to seek protection of the Court. In such a situation, the transferee brings his own suit against the transferor or the person claiming under the transferor in order to defend his right to retain his possession. Even as a plaintiff, the relief that is sought by a transferee in possession from the Court under section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act is perseverance of his possession of the property. Thus in both the positions i.e. plaintiff or defendant, the transferee in possession is defending his equitable title that he has already acquired in the property under his possession by virtue of section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act. Why a transferee in possession should wait for an action to be brought against him by the transferor or any person claiming under the transferor or a stranger to exercise his right to retain possession under section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act. Why not the transferee in possession when threatened should himself establish in a Court of law the legality of his possession by filing his own suit. If the right to seek protection under section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act is construed to be only available to a transferee if he is sued as a defendant in a suit then it would create an anomalous situation. It would then mean that it is the capacity in which a transferee in possession finds himself in a suit i.e. as a plaintiff or a defendant, which would determine whether the protection under section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act is to be extended to him. This does not appeal to reason. The right conferred upon a transferee in possession under section 53-A should not depend upon how he is described in a suit i.e. plaintiff or a defendant. This cannot be the object of the lawmakers. Statutory protection granted under section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act is available to a transferee in possession and it matters not whether he is a plaintiff or a defendant in a suit. His status as a plaintiff or defendant in a suit will be of no legal consequence while deciding his entitlement under section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act. In any of the two capacities, the transferee in possession is defending his right to retain possession, which he is already enjoying. When the transferee files his suit, he is doing nothing but defending his existing right of possession, which he is already enjoying by virtue of section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. The right of a transferee in possession granted under section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act can be availed by him whether he files his own suit or is sued as defendant. Therefore, a transferee in possession can always file suit of his own seeking the relief of permanent injunction in order to preserve his equitable title i.e. the right to enjoy possession of the property in the wake of any threat either from the transferor or any person claiming under him or even a stranger. Reliance is placed on the case of Ahmed Mujtaba Khan versus Iqbal Shah reported in 1990 CLC 1381 and a Division Bench case of Inayat Ullah v. Shah Muhammad reported in PLD 1961 Lah. 372 where it has been held that a transferee of immovable property can defend his right guaranteed to him under Section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act, whether he defends this right in his capacity as a plaintiff or a defendant.\n  15. It may also be mentioned here that though for filing a suit for specific performance of a contract, the prescribed period of limitation is three years but as the applicant has filed his suit on the basis of agreement to sell which is coupled with transfer of possession and has also sought the relief of, permanent injunction, the statute of limitation would not come in his way. Where a plaintiff continue to enjoy a right then the statute of limitation cannot take away such a right as the law of limitation is not meant to take away an existing right. It only bars remedy to gain one's lost right. The right created under section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act is an existing right and is not extinguished by any length of time. There cannot be any expiry date for enjoyment of a right conferred upon a transferee in possession under section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. Therefore, the law of limitation does not come in the way of a transferee in possession when he as a plaintiff, files his own suit to preserve his right to retain possession that is granted to him under Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act.\n  16. It may also be added here that while granting the relief of permanent injunction to transferee in possession under Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act, the Court may also direct the parties to complete the transaction under the agreement to sell. This would certainly close doors to future litigation and would also perfect the equitable title of the transferee in possession. There is no reason to deny this to the transferee in possession when it was the transferor who in the first place failed to discharge his obligation under the contract. It may be made clear that in case the transferee in possession does not perform his remaining obligation under the contract even after getting decree from the Court, then he would loose the protection and the relief granted to him under the decree shall stand recalled as he would come out of the ambit of the protection which section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act extends to a transferee in possession. On the other hand in case the transferor fails to perform his remaining obligation then the Court would get it done through its functionary, which is the normal course adopted by Courts to take the contractual obligation 'to its logical conclusion.\n  17. From the above discussion it is evident that both the Courts below committed error of misreading and non-reading of evidence on record and also did not appreciate the implication of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. The civil controversies are decided on the basis of preponderance of probabilities. Overwhelming evidence has come on record to believe the case of the applicant as his pleas with regard to his possession under the agreement to sell dated 4-3-1982 and his readiness and willingness to perform his obligation thereunder remained unshaken in evidence. Hence the impugned judgments are set aside, the Suit No.132 of 1993 filed by the applicant is decreed and the Suit No.139 of 1993 filed by Illahi Bux Mugheri is dismissed. The sale-deeds executed by Aftab Ahmed Sheikh in relation to Survey numbers 694 and 695 being based on transactions subsequent to the transaction with the applicant have no legal validity.\n",

The brief facts asserted in the plaint are that Muhammad Ishaque deceased husband of respondent No.1 was allotted a plot of 5 Marlas by Housing Committee Vehari and he constructed a house thereon Mst. Hanifan Bibi respondent No.1 filed a suit for declaration that her husband had gifted this plot to her through an agreement dated 27-11-1983 and ever-since she has been owner in possession of the said house after the death of Muhammad Ishaque the petitioners claimed that since Muhammad Ishaque was issueless, therefore, they were also entitled to inherit the property of Muhammad Ishaque as brother and sisters ultimately, respondent No.1 approached the Secretary, Housing and obtained an order dated 20-1-1986 that the plot was to be distributed amongst the heirs of deceased Muhammad Ishaque. This order was challenged in the suit. The petitioners/defendants contested the suit and on the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed:---\n  (1) Whether Tamleeq, Deed dated 27-11-1983 was duly executed in favour of plaintiff? OPP\n  (2) Whether the order of defendant No. dated 20-1-1986 is against law and facts? OPP\n  (2-A) Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action to bring this suit?

Learned counsel for the petitioners vehemently submits that the ingredients of gift are not complete in this case.\n  5. The moot point in the case is the gift deed Exh.P.1, coupled with ingredients of gift of offer, acceptance and delivery of possession. The testimony of the marginal witness Khadim Hussain P.W.2 read with the statement of Mst. Hanifan P. W.1 unequivocally proves that gift was made in favour of Mst. Hanifan. It was accepted by Mst. Hanifan. The possession was delivered to Mst. Hanifan. There is nothing in the cross examination to shake the testimony of these witnesses. Document P.1 is the pivotal point in this case. In the document it is clearly mentioned that Muhammad Ishaque the husband of Mst. Hanifan had gifted the house in question, against the dower of his wife. Thus, it was gifted-Bil-Ewaz. Though on the top of Exh.P/1, it is written an agreement. But it is settled principle of law that the document must be read as a whole.

The document as a whole establishes that it was a Hiba-bil-Ewan for all intents and purposes. It is also established on the record that respondent Mst.

Dastagir for Appellants.\n  Amanul Haq for Respondent No.1.\n  Date of hearing: 28th October, 2009.\n    JUDGMENT\n  SHAHID ANWAR BAJWA. J.--- Brief facts of the case are that respondent No.1, Trading Corporation of Pakistan (hereinafter referred to as TCP) incorporated under the Companies Ordinance, 1984 filed Civil Suit against the following:\n  (a) Messrs Cargil Incorporated (appellant No.1) (hereinafter referred to as the Cargil), It is a .company incorporated under the Laws of the United States of America.\n  (b) Messrs Alam and Alam of Karachi (appellant No.2) (hereinafter referred to as the Alams).\n  (c) Messrs Bridge Stock Eduljee and Company of Karachi (respondent No.2) (hereinafter referred to as Bridge Stock).\n  2. It was stated in the plaint that a contract was entered into between TCP and Cargil on September 3, 1981 and according to this contract Cargil issued Invoice on October 12, 1981 having sold to plaintiff commodity of \"Crude Degummed Soya Bean Oil\" in bulk weighing 15,749.344 metric tons at \"O\" and \"F\" at Karachi. Quantity received at Karachi 15,554,264 metric tons causing a loss to the TCP by short receipt of 195.080 metric tons. Quantity was sent on board a Chartered Russian Flag being Motor Tanker Komandarm Fedko showing quantity of oil as 15,799,344 metric tons as evident from the Tanker's Bill of Lading. Suit was, therefore, filed on 21-1-1982 with a prayer for decree of US$ 101,980.02 etc. Written statement was filed by Cargil, quantity of sale was admitted. It was claimed that quantity was handed over to carrier who in receipt thereof issued their clearance on board tankers Bill of Lading and Mates Receipt which showed receipt and stowage of the consignment. Consequently, liability of Cargil was denied and it was stated that liability, if any, is of Shipping Company. Alams also filed written statement and so did Bridge Stock, Trial Court framed 16 issues, vide order dated 29-7-2003 suit was dismissed by the trial Court holding, inter alia, that Carrier Company was a necessary party, Appeal No.206 of 2003 was filed and the appellate Court vide order dated 6-9-2004 allowed the appeal, Appellate Court held that carrier was not necessary party as they were made party through local agent who executed customs bond. It also held that Alam acted as commission agent who undertook survey responsibilities at the end of seller to the buyer. He being commission agent responsible for delivery of goods and since he took commission for entire quantity of goods sold. Evidence showed that he has received extensive amount of commission which was due was payable by the appellant. Being aggrieved by the order of appellate Court IInd appeal has been filed.\n  3. Learned counsel for appellant made the following submissions:\n  (i) Bill of Lading stating weight etc., it is prima facie evidence and acknowledgment of correct weight. Therefore, short landing, if any, was not responsibility of Cargil but was, responsibility of carrier.\n  (ii) Carrier was not made party. Defendant No.3 is agent of carrier but was not party and moreso because it is the agent for limited purpose. Claim of respondents, if any, is against carrier.\n  (iii) Alleged short landing of 195,080 metric tons was within the limit of 0.5 per cent permissible allowance.\n  (iv) P.W. 1 at Page 73/75 in his cross-examination admitted that he did not know whether there was any short shipping. Weight of cargo can vary due to temperature and density.\n  (v) It is not the case of short shipping but it is the case of short landing.\n  (vi) Plaint was signed by one Misbahul Haq who did not have authority or resolution of Board of Directors authorizing him to sign the plaint.\n  (vii) C.M.A. No.2970 of 2009 was filed during pendency of IInd appeal with a copy of Resolution passed by the Board of Directors of TCP on 1-9-2009. It was at a very belated stage. In any case no subsequent act can cure the fatal defect in filing the case in first place.\n  (viii) Findings of the appellate Court are against evidence.\n  (ix) Decree was not in accordance with Judgment and was in violation of Order XLI, rule 35, C.P.C.\n  Learned counsel relied upon Burjorjee Cowasjee and Co. v. Habib Insurance Co. Ltd., Karachi PLD 1975 Kar. 195 and British India Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. and another v. M.A. Wadud and Co. and others PLD 1968 Dacca 860 to contend that Customs Agent .is merely agent of the carrier for the purpose of customs formalities and cannot be liable on his own position. Learned counsel further relied upon Messrs Tar Muhammad Janoo and Co. v. Messrs Maladivian National Corporation (Ceylon) Ltd. and another PLD 1969 Kar. 495 and Messrs Crescent Sugar Mills and Distillery Ltd. v. Messrs American Export Isbrandt Sen Inc and 2 others PLD 1983 Kar. 29 to contend that Bill of Lading is acknowledgment of consignment on board and therefore it was responsibility of carrier to deliver proper quantity. Learned counsel further relied upon Dr. S.M. Rab v. national Refinery Ltd. PLD 2005 Kar. 478 and Messes Mohammad Siddique Mohammad Umer and another v. The Australasia Bank Ltd. PLD 1966 SC 684 to contend that there must be resolution by the Board of Directors before the suit is filed and subsequent ratification cannot cure the defect.\n  (x) The findings of Court below are perverse and not based on any evidence. In this regard he also relied upon Madan Gopal and 4 other v. Maran Bepari and 3 others PLC 1969 SC 617 and Mst. Rehmat Bibi v. Fazal Muhammad and others 1987 SCMR 843.\n  4. Leaned counsel for respondent (TCP) made the following submissions:---\n  (i) That consignment was on the basis of \"C\" and \"F\" freight at Karachi, Therefore, it was responsibility of seller to ensure that proper quantity is received at Karachi.\n  (ii) Irrespective of any responsibility of carrier, responsibility of seller can not be wished away in view of the fact the TCP had paid for 15,749.344 metric tons at C and F price at Karachi and is therefore entitled to receive it.\n  (iii) TCP has received an amount of Rs.195,442,20 from insurance company and therefore TCP is prepared to reduce its claim by that amount.\n  (iv) Plaint has been signed by the Principal Officer of the company viz. General Manger of the Organization and therefore resolution was not necessary. In any case subsequently Board of Directors has passed requisite resolution. He relied upon Messrs Home Comforts v. Mirza Rashid Baig and others 1992 SCMR 1290, Muhammad Hafeez and another v. District Judge, Karachi East and another 2008 SCMR 398, Sarbaland v. Allah Loke and other 1996 SCMR 575, Syed Fakhar Mahmood Gillani v. Abdul Ghafoor 1995 SCMR 96 and Abdul Rashid v. Bashiran and another 1996 SCMR 808.\n  5. I have considered the arguments of the learned counsel and material placed on record as well as the case-law.\n  6. I propose to first deal with question whether plaint was filed competently or not? As stated above the plaint was filed under the signatures of one Misbahul Haq son of Late Sirajul Haq working as General Manager' of TCP. In the body of the plaint there is no statement, whatsoever, as to how and on what basis was Mr. Misbahul Haq authorized to sign the plaint and set the bail of litigation rolling. It was 'specifically pleaded in para No.15 of written statement of Cargil that no power of attorney or authority of the signatory to the plaint has been filed with the plaint and as such plaint was contended to be not maintainable.\n  7. Issue No.4 was framed by the trial Court in the following words in this regard, \"whether the plaint has been singed and verified by proper and duly authorized representative of the plaintiff? It so, its effect.\" The trial Court held that plaint has not been signed and verified by a proper and duly constituted representative of the plaintiff TCP. This was one of the grounds on which the trial Court dismissed the suit. The Appellate Court in its judgment did not frame any issue in this regard. Therefore this particular aspect of the matter went unattended by the Appellate Court. Since a lot of emphasis has been placed on provisions of Order XXIX, (29) rule 1, C.P.C., the said rule is in the following words:---\n  \"(1) Subscription and verification of pleading.--- In suits by or against a corporation, any pleading may be signed and verified ,on behalf of the corporation by the secretary or by any director or other principal officer of the corporation who is able to depose to the facts of the case.\"\n  8. In Dr. S.M. Rab's case respondent was a Public Limited Company who had filed suit, which suit was decreed by a single Judge of this Court, against such decree High Court Appeal was filed. Question was raised whether suit filed by a company was maintainable or not. Plaint was signed by one Ahmed Javed Assistant Manager Legal and unlike the plaint in the present matter, it had been stated in the plaint as to how and in what manner said Assistant Manager was legally .authorized on behalf of company without proper seal of Board of Directors to institute the suit. However with the plaint a letter of authority was enclosed which was issued by the Managing Director. The High Court held as under:---\n  \"(23) In this authority letter again it has been nowhere disclosed/ mentioned that how the Managing Director of NRL could exercise power of delegation of authority on behalf of the company to Mr. Ahmad Javed, unless he was so empowered by the Articles of Association of the Company or there was some Board Resolution in his favour for this purpose with further power of delegation of powers on behalf of the Company. The legal point as to the consequences of non-conferring of proper authority on behalf of the Company through Board Resolution in favour of a person who had instituted the suit on behalf of company vis-a-vis maintainability of the suit in such situation, when came for consideration in the case of Khan Iftikhar Hussain Khan (supra), the apex Court observed as under:\n  \"On the facts of the present case I am satisfied that due notice of meeting was not given to the deceased appellant and therefore Resolution passed in the meeting of 28th September, 1951 cannot be said to be a valid one. In my opinion,, no valid authority was conferred on Mr. Khursheed Mehmood and, therefore, he was not competent to institute the suit. I would, therefore, hold that the learned trial Judge was perfectly justified in dismissing the suit on this ground.\"\n  (24) In view of the above discussed undisputed facts and the legal position about the mode of conferring authority on behalf of a public limited company we hold that Suit No.1001/1997 instituted on behalf 'of NRL by its Assistant Manager Legal was not competently instituted and it was thus not maintainable in law.\"\n  9. In Australasia Bank's case, which incidently was decided by four members Bench of the honourable Supreme Court and, in their turn of course, all the four members rose to become Chief Justices of Pakistan. Honourable Supreme Court held that if power of attorney is given with seal of the company and signed by two Directors and the plaint is signed by such attorney and the case is instituted, it would be held to be competently filed. In Khan Iftikhar Hussain Khan of Mamdot's (represented by 6 heirs) v. Messrs Ghulam Nabi Corporation Ltd., Lahore PLD 1971 SC 550, it was held that in law a meeting of Directors is not duly convened unless due notice had been given to all the Directors and given facts of the case, since due notice was held not to have been so given, no authority was held to have been conferred upon the officer who instituted the suit. The Honourable Supreme Court upheld dismissal of the suit on this ground.\n  10. Messrs Razo (Pvt.) Limited v. The Director, Karachi City Region Employees Old Age Benefit Institution, and others 2005 CLD 1208 is case, decided by a Division Bench of this Court. In this case, a constitutional petition was instituted without resolution of Board of Directors. However after institution of constitutional petition such resolution was passed. Division Bench of the High Court laid down the law in the following words:---\n  \"From the discussion on this issue there is hardly any doubt with regard to the maintainability of this constitutional petition. The Constitutional petition was filed by a person who was not authorized/empowered to file the same on behalf of the petitioner Company Messrs Razo (Pvt.) Ltd. as he was not duly authorized/empowered by means of a Resolution of the Board of Directors passed in a proper meeting of the Board of Directors. \"There is also no dispute with regard to the fact that the illegal/unauthorized act of Saeed Ahmed Memon in filing/instituting the above Constitutional petition without authority or power could not be ratified or clothed with\" legality by a subsequent Resolution by the Board of Directors conferring on him to file/institute, conduct defend compound or abandon the legal proceedings as the Supreme Court in the case of (i) Messrs Muhammad Siddique Muhammad Umar and another (supra) and (2) Khan Iftikhar Hussain Khan of Mamdot (supra) had pronounced that any proceedings or pleadings filed/instituted by a director, secretary or Principal officer on behalf of a private limited company not having been duly authorized by Resolution by the Board of Directos to do so was liable to be dismissed on this ground alone.\"\n  11. In Abubakar Saley Mayet v. Abbot Laboratories and another, 1987 CLC 367, relying upon Khan Iftikhar Hussain Khan of Mandot's case, it was held that suit filed by an officer of company who had no authority to do so would be nullity in the eyes of law and plaint was non-existent for all intents and purposes. It was further held that Order XXIX C.P.C. comes into operation only after proceedings have been validly instituted and cannot be utilized for unauthorized persons to prosecute suits on behalf of the Corporation. International Insurance Corporation and others v. Pakistan National Shipping Corporation and others 2006 CLD 85, it was held that Order XXIX, C.P.C. only permits the person mentioned in it to sign and verify pleadings and does not deal with framing of the suit nor authorizes an institution of the suit.\n  12. Messrs Home Comforts's case, relied upon by learned counsel for the respondent, relates to ejectment application under Rent Restriction Laws and does not even involve this particular question, Same is the position in Muhammad Hafiz's case, Sarbaland's case is in respect of scope of scrutiny in second appeal. In Syed Fakhar Mahmood Gillani case learned counsel referred to the statement that presumption of correctness was attached to every official act done in discharge of duty. I am afraid it is of no help to the petitioner. Such presumption may be available to an act by a State functionary but not to an officer of a private limited company. Abdul Rashid case is also in respect of scope of scrutiny in second appeal.\n  13. As stated above, litigation between the parties started in 1983 and the Board woke up and passed a resolution on September 1, 2009. Appellant vehemently contended it was 26 years too late. The above discussion leads me to the conclusion that provision of Order XXIX, rule 1, C.P.C. allows the person to sign on behalf of the corporation but such person, unless he has been conferred an authority by the Board of Directors of the Corporation cannot act on part of the corporation. In S.M. Rab case, it was held that even an authority given by Chief Executive is not sufficient and in Mohammad Siddique case it was held that even a resolution passed by the Board of Directors without complying with legal requirements of holding meeting of Board of Directors will not be of any legal consequence in this regard. It is of course available to the Board, by resolution, to authorize certain officers of the organization to appoint attorneys for such purposes through instruments of such appointment as attorneys, duly and properly executed.\n  14. Such resolution of the Board must be passed before institution of proceedings and not after the proceedings had been instituted, As in Razo (Pvt.) Limited case the Division Bench of this Court has held that such proceedings instituted prior to passing of such resolution cannot be ratified or \"clothed with legality\" by subsequent resolution. Therefore I hold that in the eyes of law the plaint was incompetently filed. In law it is to be presumed that the plaint was never filed. In view of my above findings I do not think that it would be necessary to go to other submissions made by the learned counsel.\n  15. Therefore I allow this appeal, set aside the order of the appellate Court and restore the order of the trial Court. The Appeal is, therefore, allowed with costs.\n  M.U.Y./C-27/K Appeal allowed.",

      "case_facts": " Brief facts of the case are that respondent No.1, Trading Corporation of Pakistan (hereinafter referred to as TCP) incorporated under the Companies Ordinance, 1984 filed Civil Suit against the following:\n  (a) Messrs Cargil Incorporated (appellant No.1) (hereinafter referred to as the Cargil), It is a .company incorporated under the Laws of the United States of America.\n  (b) Messrs Alam and Alam of Karachi (appellant No.2) (hereinafter referred to as the Alams).\n  (c) Messrs Bridge Stock Eduljee and Company of Karachi (respondent No.2) (hereinafter referred to as Bridge Stock).\n  2. It was stated in the plaint that a contract was entered into between TCP and Cargil on September 3, 1981 and according to this contract Cargil issued Invoice on October 12, 1981 having sold to plaintiff commodity of \"Crude Degummed Soya Bean Oil\" in bulk weighing 15,749.344 metric tons at \"O\" and \"F\" at Karachi. Quantity received at Karachi 15,554,264 metric tons causing a loss to the TCP by short receipt of 195.080 metric tons. Quantity was sent on board a Chartered Russian Flag being Motor Tanker Komandarm Fedko showing quantity of oil as 15,799,344 metric tons as evident from the Tanker's Bill of Lading. Suit was, therefore, filed on 21-1-1982 with a prayer for decree of US$ 101,980.02 etc. Written statement was filed by Cargil, quantity of sale was admitted. It was claimed that quantity was handed over to carrier who in receipt thereof issued their clearance on board tankers Bill of Lading and Mates Receipt which showed receipt and stowage of the consignment. Consequently, liability of Cargil was denied and it was stated that liability, if any, is of Shipping Company. Alams also filed written statement and so did Bridge Stock, Trial Court framed 16 issues, vide order dated 29-7-2003 suit was dismissed by the trial Court holding, inter alia, that Carrier Company was a necessary party, Appeal No.206 of 2003 was filed and the appellate Court vide order dated 6-9-2004 allowed the appeal, Appellate Court held that carrier was not necessary party as they were made party through local agent who executed customs bond. It also held that Alam acted as commission agent who undertook survey responsibilities at the end of seller to the buyer. He being commission agent responsible for delivery of goods and since he took commission for entire quantity of goods sold. Evidence showed that he has received extensive amount of commission which was due was payable by the appellant. Being aggrieved by the order of appellate Court IInd appeal has been filed.",
      "case_judgement": "Such resolution of the Board must be passed before institution of proceedings and not after the proceedings had been instituted, As in Razo (Pvt.)

      "case_proceddings": "Learned counsel for appellant made the following submissions:\n  (i) Bill of Lading stating weight etc., it is prima facie evidence and acknowledgment of correct weight. Therefore, short landing, if any, was not responsibility of Cargil but was, responsibility of carrier.\n  (ii) Carrier was not made party. Defendant No.3 is agent of carrier but was not party and moreso because it is the agent for limited purpose. Claim of respondents, if any, is against carrier.\n  (iii) Alleged short landing of 195,080 metric tons was within the limit of 0.5 per cent permissible allowance.\n  (iv) P.W. 1 at Page 73/75 in his cross-examination admitted that he did not know whether there was any short shipping. Weight of cargo can vary due to temperature and density.\n  (v) It is not the case of short shipping but it is the case of short landing.\n  (vi) Plaint was signed by one Misbahul Haq who did not have authority or resolution of Board of Directors authorizing him to sign the plaint.\n  (vii) C.M.A. No.2970 of 2009 was filed during pendency of IInd appeal with a copy of Resolution passed by the Board of Directors of TCP on 1-9-2009. It was at a very belated stage. In any case no subsequent act can cure the fatal defect in filing the case in first place.\n  (viii) Findings of the appellate Court are against evidence.\n  (ix) Decree was not in accordance with Judgment and was in violation of Order XLI, rule 35, C.P.C.\n  Learned counsel relied upon Burjorjee Cowasjee and Co. v.

M.A. Wadud and Co. and others PLD 1968 Dacca 860 to contend that Customs Agent .is merely agent of the carrier for the purpose of customs formalities and cannot be liable on his own position.

Succinctly the facts giving rise to this revision petition are that the respondents/plaintiffs had filed a suit for declaration on 18-3-1985 to the effect that mortgage deed No.1762, dated 6-11-1982, regarding Shop No.103, Block \"G\", Burewala, amounting to Rs.4,00,000 as collateral security was liable to stamp duty Rs.4,000 only as registration fee and that the same has already been paid; that the demand of Rs.11,000 as additional stamp duty and the second demand of another amount of Rs.11,000 as registration fee through notice dated 1-3-1985 was illegal, void, without notice against facts and was liable to be set aside. It was further prayed that the appellants/defendants may be restrained from demanding said amount of Rs.22,000 on the mortgage deed. The suit was contested by the appellants/defendants by filing written their respective written statements controverting the assertions of the plaint and the trial Court out of the divergent pleadings of the parties proceeded to frame six ' issues including that of the relief; both the sides led evidence in support of their respective claims and the trial Court after considering the same decreed the suit of the respondents/plaintiffs vide judgment and- decree dated 16-12-1992; being aggrieved of the said judgment and decree, the petitioners/defendants preferred appeal before the learned District Judge, Vehari, which was entrusted to a learned Additional District Judge, who vide judgment and decree dated dismissed the same vide judgment and decree dated 3-5-1995. Hence, the instant revision petition.\n  3. It has been contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the judgments and decrees of the Courts below are based on misreading and non-reading of evidence available on the record, whereby a grave miscarriage of justice has been caused to the petitioners; that the findings on the issues given by both the Courts below are not sustainable at law; that the Courts below have .misinterpreted the documents Exh. P.1 and Mark \"A\", wherein it is clearly written that advance limit was Rs.15,00,000, therefore, the Auditor had rightly objected that the respondents/plaintiffs should have paid additional amount of Rs.22,000 as stamp duty and registration fee. Lastly, it has been argued that the respondents/plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief sought for as they -had neither raised any objection through an application before the Treasury Officer nor had they filed any appeal before the Registrar or Collector, therefore, the Civil Court has no jurisdiction to try the suit.\n  4. The learned counsel for the respondents/plaintiffs vehemently argued that they have proved their claim by producing cogent evidence and the Courts below have arrived at concurrent findings, which cannot be disturbed by this Court., unless any misreading or non-reading of evidence has been pointed out.\n  5. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at considerable length and have also gone through the impugned judgments and decrees of the Courts below.\n  6. It has been observed that in order to prove their claim, one of the respondents/plaintiffs, namely, Muhammad Ayub had appeared as P.W. 1 and had in a nutshell narrated the story of the plaint. In rebuttal, the petitioners/defendants got examined Bashir Ahmad, Registeri Clerk, Burewala as D.W.1, who deposed that on 6-11-1982, the mortgage of Rs.4,00,000 was registered by the Sub-Registrar, Burewala; but the advance limit of loan in this mortgage was Rs.15,00,000 and therefore, the auditor objected that the plaintiff should have paid additional amount of Rs.22,000 as fee, whereupon notice was issued to the respondents/ plaintiffs. He had admitted that in the registered mortgage deed it was mentioned that the advance limit was Rs.15,00,000 and that the shop was mortgaged for Rs.4,00,000. After considering evidence led by both the sides, the learned trial Judge had proceeded to observe that it is clear that the real mortgage was for Rs.4,00,000 and stamp duty and registration fee of Rs.8,000 had been correctly paid by the respondents/ plaintiffs and in this way the demand of the petitioner/defendants was declared illegal. The learned Additional District Judge while dealing with the appeal filed by the petitioners/defendants has also considered each and every aspect of the matter and has rightly come to the conclusion that the demand of the petitioners/defendants was illegal and void.\n  7. Perusal of the impugned judgments and decrees reveals that the conclusions arrived at by both the Courts below are elaborate and are based on cogent reasons. No misreading or non-reading of evidence or any other legal infirmity has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioners with the judgments rendered by the Courts below warranting interference by this Court in revisional jurisdiction. As per the dictum of law laid down by honourable apex Court in cases of Aurangzeb through legal heirs and others v. Muhammad Jaffar and another 2007 SCMR 236, Shafi Muhammad and others v. Khanzada Gul and others 2007 SCMR 368 and Rashid Ahmad v. Said Ahmad 2007 SCMR 926, concurrent findings of fact recorded by the Courts below are not open to exception unless it is established that the same suffered from any jurisdictional defect or were based on misreading or non-reading of evidence, which elements are conspicuously lacking in the present civil revision.\n  8. Resultantly, there being no merit in this revision petition, the same is hereby dismissed. No order as to costs.\n  H.B.T./P-35/L Petition dismissed.",

It is specifically mentioned in the agreement that the management of contract for agricultural purposes, executed in favour of the petitioner, was only upto 30th June, 2008 and even during the subsistence of contract the AA&QMG had the authority to terminate such contract without notice or otherwise three months notice on either side was to be given. The said agreement further contemplates that the agreement will automatically terminate on orders from higher authorities; if contractor is found insolvent; if there is breach of conditions contained therein. Such terms contained in the agreement clearly demonstrate the intention of the parties that the petitioner was retained as contractor for the management of agricultural land on yearly basis at the discretion of respondents Nos.2 and 3. It is therefore, obvious that respondents Nos.2 and 3 were within their rights in serving the notice dated 8th May, 2008, and on expiry of the contract period on 30th June, 2008, the petitioner has lost his legal claim over the land except as contemplated in clause 4 of the agreement dated 1-7-2007, for which already an offer has been made to him by the respondents as per para 4 of the counter affidavit dated 6-8-2008. Besides, if the petitioner has any other claim against the respondents for commission of breach of the terms of contract or for the loss suffered by him, such factual controversies emanating from the terms of the contract, cannot be adjudicated by this Court in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction. Rather, it will be appropriate for the petitioner to approach the civil Court for such reliefs, if he can succeed to establish his claim against the respondents.\n  Foregoing are the reasons for our short order dated 3-9-2008, whereby this petition was dismissed in limine.\"\n  After dismissal of the Constitution Petition, the plaintiff has filed the present suit on 5-9-2008, seeking following reliefs:---\n  (a) To declare the notice dated 8-5-2008, issued to the plaintiff for termination of contract is illegal, mala fide when the defendant No.2, received payment for further period of contract on 6-6-2008, from the plaintiff therefore above notice is to be withdraw by defendants Nos.2 and 3 being illegal, mala fide and against the cannons of Justice and equity.\n  (b) To cancel the contract dated 6-5-2008 and 18-6-2008, awarded to the defendant No.5 illegally, malafidely by defendants Nos.2 and 3 to deprive the plaintiff from cultivation of 184 acres of Army Landhi land, Karachi.\n  (c) That the defendants Nos.2, 3 and 5 be restrained from demolishing, evicting, removing ripe crop, standing on 184 acres Army Landhi land, Karachi, tube-well, tractors, electric machines, 1000 underground pipelines and creating third party interest in the land in question till the final disposal of the suit.\n  (d) Costs of the proceeding may also be awarded.\n  (e) Any other relief this Honourable Court deem fit and proper as per the circumstances of the petition.\n  The plaintiff was the lessee of the defendants, who from time to time was granted Army land for cultivation purposes on yearly basis. The last agreement was executed on 1-7-2007 and was to expire on 30-6-2008. On 8-5-2008 when two months remained, the termination notice was served upon the plaintiff and it was made clear to the plaintiff that contract shall not be renewed and the plaintiff should make necessary arrangements to hand over the land. The plaintiff however, did not hand over the land upon expiry of the term and instead he first filed constitution petition and after its dismissal filed the present suit. In the present suit, the plaintiff has again prayed that the notice dated 8-5-2008 be declared as illegal and mala fide and sought cancellation of the contract, that was awarded to defendant No.5 after the expiry of his contract.\n  The learned counsel for the plaintiff has contended that in last paragraph of the order passed in C.P. No.1500 of 2008, the honourable Division Bench has acknowledged the right of the plaintiff to file civil suit with regard to his claim and therefore she contended that the application under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. is not maintainable and liable to be dismissed.\n  I have gone through the order of the Division Bench of this Court passed in C.P. No.1500 of 2008. There is clear findings that the defendants Nos.2 and 3 were within their right in serving the notice dated 8-5-2008 and on expiry of the contract period on 30-6-2008, the plaintiff has lost his legal claim over the land except as contemplated in clause 4 of the agreement dated 1-7-2007. It was also held that if there was 'any claim of the plaintiff against the defendants Nos.2 and 3 with regard to any branch of the terms of the contract or for the loss suffered by him on account of such breach, the same cannot be adjudicated in the constitutional jurisdiction but in appropriate proceedings before the civil Court.\n  In the present suit, the plaintiff has sought relief that the notice dated 8-5-2008 be declared as illegal and subsequent award of contract after expiry of plaintiff's contract should be declared as illegal. Hence the entire grievance pertains to termination of contract and for the consequential reliefs that emanate from such termination and nothing else. No claim for any loss has been raised in the present suit. In the case of Muhammad Chiragh-ud-din Bhatti v. Province of West Pakistan reported in 1971 SCMR 447, it was held that even if section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code may not in terms apply in support of plea of res judicata in a writ proceeding it can hardly be disputed that the general principles of res judicata are always attracted to debar the petitioner from re-agitating the controversy afresh in a civil suit, which had been put at rest by a judgment of the High Court passed in writ jurisdiction and the Civil Court could not by pass or override the orders of the High Court competently made in another jurisdiction on the same subject between the same parties.\n  Since the scope of the present suit is within the scope of controversy that was subject matter of constitution petition that was filed by the plaintiff and the same has been put at rest, the principle laid down in section 11, C.P.C. is fully attracted to the present case and the plaint is liable to be rejected. Hence, this application is allowed and the plaint is rejected under Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. However, for any other claim that has not been taken in the present suit to which the plaintiff may be otherwise entitled to, he may agitate the same in appropriate proceedings if permissible in law and if he is so advised.\n  Upon rejection of the plaint the suit stands disposed of along with all other listed applications.\n  S.A.K./Q-5/K Plaint rejected.",

The said connection is for the steel manufacturing factory of the petitioner situated at Momenpura, Lahore. Respondents conducted a raid on the said factory on the basis of a report that the petitioner was stealing electricity. An F.I.R. was lodged on 12-6-2009 against the petitioner and others and the electricity connection of the petitioner was disconnected.\n  2. Thereafter on 14-7-2009 the petitioner was served with a notice under section 24 of the Electricity Act, 1910 for a detection bill in the sum of Rs.1,45,92,448 for the period 118 to 5/9.\n  3. The petitioner challenged the said notice through a suit for declaration and permanent injunction. During the pendency of the suit the petitioner moved an application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. praying for ad-interim injunction i.e. restoration of electricity and restraining the recovery of the detection bill. The said application was dismissed on 22-7-2009. Appeal preferred against the said order by the petitioner was also dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge, Lahore vide order dated '5-9-2009. The petitioner has impugned the orders of the subordinate Courts in the instant petition.\n  4. The main argument of the counsel for the petitioner is that his case falls under section 26-A of the Electricity Act and not under section 24 and therefore, section 54-C of the Electricity Act does not apply, which pertains to the Bar of Jurisdiction and provides that the entire amount assessed against the consumer shall be deposited as a pre-requisite for restoration of the electricity. The counsel further argued that the action of the respondents is unlawful and the detection bill is absolutely illegal.\n  5. Counsel for the respondents opposes the submissions of the petitioner and supports the-orders of the subordinate Courts.\n  6. Arguments heard and record perused.\n  7. The only question that surfaces for determination by this Court is whether section 24(1) of the Electricity Act, 1910 is applicable to the case of the petitioner. It is, therefore, important to re-produce the relevant section required for the disposal of this petition.\n  \"Section 24(1). Discontinuance of supply to consumer neglecting to pay charge.--- (1) Where any consumer neglects to pay any charge for energy or any sum, other than a charge for energy, assessed against him by a licensee in respect of supply of energy to his premises, (emphasis supplied) the licensee may after giving not less than seven clear days notice is writing to such consumer and without prejudice to his right recover such charge or other sum by suit or otherwise, cut-off the supply and for that purpose cut or disconnect any electric supply-line or other works, being the property of the licensee through which energy may be supplied to such premises or to any other premises, other than domestic premises, running distinctly in the name of such consumer, and may discontinue the supply until such charge or other sum, together with any expenses incurred by him in cutting off and reconnecting the supply and the minimum charges on account of continued reservation of supply during the period of such discontinuance, are paid, but not longer.\n  (2) Where any difference or dispute as to any matter connected with any charge or other sum included in the bill of licensee has been referred by a consumer under this' Act to an Electric Inspector before the notice as aforesaid has been given by the licensee, the licensee shall not exercise the powers conferred by subsection (1) until the inspector has given his decision.\"\n  \"Section 26-A. Dishonest abstraction or consumption of energy.---Notwithstanding anything contained in section 23, the licensee may charge the consumer on the basis of one or more of the following considerations for the amount of energy deemed to have been dishonestly abstracted, consumed or used for the period during which, the meter, maximum demand indicator or other measuring apparatus had, in the opinion of he licensee, remained disconnected, injured, altered or prevented from registering the amount of energy supplied for the electrical quantity contained in the supply:\n  (a) consumer's connected load or maximum demand in kilowatt during any period;\n  (b) consumer's maximum consumption of energy in kilowatt hours during any period;\n  (c) consumer's load factor;\n  (d) the power factor of consumer's load;\n  (e) the hours and the time for which the energy is deemed to have been abstracted, consumed or used by the consumer; and\n  (f) the purpose for which the energy is deemed to have been abstracted, consumed or used by the consumer.\"\n  \"Section 54-C. Bar of Jurisdiction.--- (1) Where a licensee gives a notice referred to in sub-section (1) of section 24 or discontinues supply of energy to a premises under the provisions of this Act no Court shall make an order prohibiting the licensee form discontinuing supply of energy to the premises, or requiring him to restore supply of energy to such premises, and any such order made before the commencement of the electricity (Amendment) Ordinance, 1979, shall cease to have effect;\n  (2) Where an amount has been deposited under subsection (1), the Court shall direct it to be deposited in a scheduled bank in the name of the licensee on an undertaking being furnished by the licensee to the effect that in case the suit or appeal is decided against him, he shall repay the said amount to the plaintiff or appellant, as the case may be, with such reasonable returns as the Court may determine.\"\n  8. Section 24(1) clearly states that where any consumer neglects to pay any charge for energy or any sum assessed against him by licensee in respect of supply of energy to his premises, the licensee may disconnect the supply of energy for the said consumer. In the present case the detection bill falls within the category of \"charge for energy\" assessed by the licensee.\n  9. The reference to section 26A by the counsel for the petitioner is misplaced. The said section deals with the computation of the detection bill and is not per se a recovery provision. In fact section 26-A provides c the parameters to work out the charge of energy/detection bill in case the measuring apparatus in the opinion of the licensee remained disconnected. Once the charge of energy is calculated, section 24(1) comes into play and so does section 54-C of the Art.\n  10. The section 54-C clearly states that if a notice is served on the consumer under section 24(1) or if the supply of energy to the premises of the consumer is discontinued under the provisions of the Electricity Act, no Court shall restore supply of energy without the deposit of the assessed amount. Section 54-C, therefore, is trigged not only by notice under section 24(1) but also for any other reason under the Act the supply of energy to the premises of the consumer are discontinued.\n  11. Reading of sections 24(1), 26-A and 54-C of the Act shows that the licensee has a right to disconnect electricity if the consumer neglects to pay any charge for energy. In the present case detection bill has been served on the petitioner which is charge of energy assessed by the licensee and, therefore, the impugned action/disconnection is fully covered under the said sections. Therefore, the subordinate Courts have rightly applied the provisions of the Electricity Act, 1910 and disallowed the interim relief to the petitioner. There is no illegality or material irregularity noticed in the impugned orders.\n  12. For the above reasons, this petition is dismissed.\n  M. U. Y. /M-855/L Petition dismissed.",

EBRAHIM, J.--- This application under Order XXXIX, rules 1 and 2 read with section 151, C.P.C. has been filed -by the plaintiff seeking restraining order against the defendant and his employees, workers, subordinates, person(s) from selling, encumbering, letting, gifting, mortgaging, transferring or dealing in any manner with any person in respect of second and third floor portion along with the roof of the suit property situated on Plot No.27, Bihar Colony, Jamshed Road No.3, Karachi. Ad interim orders were passed on 18-11-2008 and the defendant was restrained from creating third party interest in respect of the second and third floor and from parting with possession of the second floor.\n  It is the case of the plaintiff that he had entered into a sale agreement dated 6-2-2008 for the purchase of second (comprising of two flats) and third floor comprising of two flats of the building along with the roof proposed to be constructed on Plot No.27, Bihar Colony, Jamshed Road No.3, Karachi, (hereinafter referred to as the suit property) for total sale consideration amounting to Rs.38,00,000. The plaintiff has paid to the defendant a sum of Rs.17,50,000 in instalments as on 15-5-2008 in terms of the said sale agreement although he was only required to pay a sum of Rs.10,00,000. The defendant was required to construct second and third floor of the building and possession of the suit property was to be handed over to the plaintiff within a period of four 'months and plaintiff was required to pay to the defendant the balance sale consideration.\n  The learned counsel of the plaintiff has argued that the defendant had not completed the construction of the suit property in terms of the sale agreement and as per mutual arrangement defendant had arranged a Flat No.G-2, Ground Floor, Labbaik Plaza, Plot No.36-39-64 opposite Sulemania Masjid, Ganj Shakar Colony, Zeera Chowk, Jamsheed Road No.1, Karachi for occupation of plaintiff, with the assurance that possession of the two flats on the second floor would be handed over to the plaintiff within 25 -days. Thereafter, the plaintiff approached the defendant for the delivery of possession of the flats on the second floor of the building as per mutual agreement but the defendant with ulterior and mala fide reasons refused to hand over possession of the second floor and also further committed breach of the agreement by not construction the third floor.\n  It has been argued by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that after receipt of the sum of Rs.17,50,000 the defendant became dishonest and wanted to sell third floor and roof top to some other person to make unlawful gains and to usurp the right of the plaintiff. The agreements of sale between the defendant and Mrs. Farzana Shahid and Mr. Altaf are forged, fabricated and sham documents prepared by the defendant to play fraud. The learned counsel has argued that no evidence of payments have been produced by the defendant as no sale consideration was paid by the said purchasers, the market value of flats on second and third floor could not be the same. Surprisingly both the plots were sold and identical agreements were executed on the same date with two different purchasers. The learned counsel further submits that no title has been transferred in favour of the purchasers as only alleged sale agreements have been executed fraudulently. Even otherwise on 19-11-2008 flat on the third floor was not constructed (which is evident from Nazir's report dated 19-5-2009) and therefore defendant could not possibly hand over possession of the third floor to the alleged purchaser and it is for this reason the defendant has not produced the bills of utilities as undertaken given to Nazir. Learned counsel further states that the plaintiff has not received any notice of cancellation of the sale agreement therefore defendant cannot unilaterally cancel the agreement of sale without first giving any notice and refunding the sum of Rs.17,50,000 to the plaintiff. He also referred a decision of Union Administration, Union Council No.10 Jamshed Town, wherein it has been admitted that defendant agreed to sell the suit property and had received a sum of Rs.17,50,000. In the said decision nothing has been mentioned as to cancellation of the said agreement of sale or to the completion of the third floor.\n  In the written statement the defendant has stated that there was an oral agreement whereby the plaintiff had agreed to give loan amounting to Rs.38,00,000 to the defendant so that the defendant could construct second and third floors and after constructing the plaintiff would have the option to purchase the same. Since plaintiff did not pay the entire loan amount of Rs.38,00,000 therefore, he allotted the flat to some other persons as defendant was in need of urgent funds for construction of the building, vide two separate sale agreements both dated 19-11-2008. However, in the counter-affidavit the execution of Agreement of sale dated 6-2-2008 and receipt by the defendant are denied. It has been stated that the defendant had entered into an Agreement for sale of two flats on second floor and two flats on the third floor only (each flat for Rs.9,50,000) and since the plaintiff failed to pay the balance sale consideration therefore the defendant had cancelled the agreement vide legal notice dated 8-10-2008 and after the decision of the Union Council the said flats on the second and third floors were sold to two different persons vide agreements dated 19-11-2008.\n  It is contended by the learned counsel for the defendant that sale agreement dated 6-2-2008 was fabricated, forged and fake document and no such document was executed by the defendant. Since the plaintiff failed to pay the balance amount of Rs.20,50,000 the defendant had cancelled the agreement vide legal notice dated 29-9-2008 and thereafter defendant sold the flats constructed on second and third floor on 19-11-2008 to Mrs. Farzana Shahid and Mr. Altaf respectively. The learned counsel for the defendant submits that no stay can be granted as the defendant has sold the said flats on the second and third floors to the above named persons vide agreements of sale dated 19-11-2008 before notice of stay application was served on the defendant.\n  After hearing the arguments of the learned counsel, perusal of the documents, it can be prima facie concluded that (a) there was some agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant whereby the suit property was to be sold by the defendant to the plaintiff after completion of the suit property by the defendant (b) there was some delay on the part of the defendant to complete the construction, (c) a sum of Rs.17,50,000 was paid by the plaintiff to the defendant, (d) no title has been transferred in favour of alleged purchasers by the defendant and (e) the defendant had also delivered the possession of all that Flat No.G-2, Ground Floor, Labbaik Plaza, Plot No.36-39-64 opposite Sulemania Masjid, Ganj Shakar Colony, Zeera Chowk, Jamsheed Road No.1, Karachi for occupation of plaintiff, which is still in the possession of the plaintiff.\n  Plaintiff has made out a prima facie case and the balance of convenience lies in his favour as he paid a sum of Rs.17,50,000 to the defendant which has been admitted by the defendant. For the aforesaid reasons defendant is hereby directed not to hand over the possession of the roof, top to any person and further not to 'dispose of, convey or transfer the suit property to any person by way of sale-deed, sub-lease deed or any other transfer deed. The above restraining order shall be subject to the plaintiff depositing the balance sale consideration amounting to Rs.19,00,000 with the Nazir of this Court within one month from the date hereof. The Nazir shall invest this amount along with the earlier amount of Rs.1,50,000 deposited by the plaintiff in some government profit bearing security.\n  C.M.A. No.10902 of 2008\n  In view of above order this application is also disposed of with the direction that the defendant and all persons claiming through under the defendant are hereby restrained from removing or evicting the plaintiff from Flat No.G-2, Ground Floor, Labbaik Plaza, Plot No.36-39-64, opposite Sulemania Masjid, Ganj Shakar Colony Zeera Chowk Jamsheed Road No.1 till disposal of the suit. The plaintiff shall be liable to pay all utility bills in respect of this flat directly to the relevant authorities.\n  M.H./B-1/K Application allowed.",

Ad interim orders were passed on 18-11-2008 and the defendant was restrained from creating third party interest in respect of the second and third floor and from parting with possession of the second floor.\n  It is the case of the plaintiff that he had entered into a sale agreement dated 6-2-2008 for the purchase of second (comprising of two flats) and third floor comprising of two flats of the building along with the roof proposed to be constructed on Plot No.27, Bihar Colony, Jamshed Road No.3, Karachi, (hereinafter referred to as the suit property) for total sale consideration amounting to Rs.38,00,000. The plaintiff has paid to the defendant a sum of Rs.17,50,000 in instalments as on 15-5-2008 in terms of the said sale agreement although he was only required to pay a sum of Rs.10,00,000. The defendant was required to construct second and third floor of the building and possession of the suit property was to be handed over to the plaintiff within a period of four 'months and plaintiff was required to pay to the defendant the balance sale consideration.\n ",
      "case_judgement": " Plaintiff has made out a prima facie case and the balance of convenience lies in his favour as he paid a sum of Rs.17,50,000 to the defendant which has been admitted by the defendant. For the aforesaid reasons defendant is hereby directed not to hand over the possession of the roof, top to any person and further not to 'dispose of, convey or transfer the suit property to any person by way of sale-deed, sub-lease deed or any other transfer deed. The above restraining order shall be subject to the plaintiff depositing the balance sale consideration amounting to Rs.19,00,000 with the Nazir of this Court within one month from the date hereof. The Nazir shall invest this amount along with the earlier amount of Rs.1,50,000 deposited by the plaintiff in some government profit bearing security.\n  C.M.A. No.10902 of 2008\n  In view of above order this application is also disposed of with the direction that the defendant and all persons claiming through under the defendant are hereby restrained from removing or evicting the plaintiff from Flat No.G-2, Ground Floor, Labbaik Plaza, Plot No.36-39-64, opposite Sulemania Masjid, Ganj Shakar Colony Zeera Chowk Jamsheed Road No.1 till disposal of the suit. The plaintiff shall be liable to pay all utility bills in respect of this flat directly to the relevant authorities.\n  M.H./B-1/K Application allowed.",
      "case_proceddings": "The learned counsel of the plaintiff has argued that the defendant had not completed the construction of the suit property in terms of the sale agreement and as per mutual arrangement defendant had arranged a Flat No.G-2, Ground Floor, Labbaik Plaza, Plot No.36-39-64 opposite Sulemania Masjid, Ganj Shakar Colony, Zeera Chowk, Jamsheed Road No.1, Karachi for occupation of plaintiff, with the assurance that possession of the two flats on the second floor would be handed over to the plaintiff within 25 -days. Thereafter, the plaintiff approached the defendant for the delivery of possession of the flats on the second floor of the building as per mutual agreement but the defendant with ulterior and mala fide reasons refused to hand over possession of the second floor and also further committed breach of the agreement by not construction the third floor.\n  It has been argued by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that after receipt of the sum of Rs.17,50,000 the defendant became dishonest and wanted to sell third floor and roof top to some other person to make unlawful gains and to usurp the right of the plaintiff. The agreements of sale between the defendant and Mrs. Farzana Shahid and Mr. Altaf are forged, fabricated and sham documents prepared by the defendant to play fraud. The learned counsel has argued that no evidence of payments have been produced by the defendant as no sale consideration was paid by the said purchasers, the market value of flats on second and third floor could not be the same. Surprisingly both the plots were sold and identical agreements were executed on the same date with two different purchasers. The learned counsel further submits that no title has been transferred in favour of the purchasers as only alleged sale agreements have been executed fraudulently. Even otherwise on 19-11-2008 flat on the third floor was not constructed (which is evident from Nazir's report dated 19-5-2009) and therefore defendant could not possibly hand over possession of the third floor to the alleged purchaser and it is for this reason the defendant has not produced the bills of utilities as undertaken given to Nazir. Learned counsel further states that the plaintiff has not received any notice of cancellation of the sale agreement therefore defendant cannot unilaterally cancel the agreement of sale without first giving any notice and refunding the sum of Rs.17,50,000 to the plaintiff. He also referred a decision of Union Administration, Union Council No.10 Jamshed Town, wherein it has been admitted that defendant agreed to sell the suit property and had received a sum of Rs.17,50,000. In the said decision nothing has been mentioned as to cancellation of the said agreement of sale or to the completion of the third floor.\n  In the written statement the defendant has stated that there was an oral agreement whereby the plaintiff had agreed to give loan amounting to Rs.38,00,000 to the defendant so that the defendant could construct second and third floors and after constructing the plaintiff would have the option to purchase the same. Since plaintiff did not pay the entire loan amount of Rs.38,00,000 therefore, he allotted the flat to some other persons as defendant was in need of urgent funds for construction of the building, vide two separate sale agreements both dated 19-11-2008. However, in the counter-affidavit the execution of Agreement of sale dated 6-2-2008 and receipt by the defendant are denied. It has been stated that the defendant had entered into an Agreement for sale of two flats on second floor and two flats on the third floor only (each flat for Rs.9,50,000) and since the plaintiff failed to pay the balance sale consideration therefore the defendant had cancelled the agreement vide legal notice dated 8-10-2008 and after the decision of the Union Council the said flats on the second and third floors were sold to two different persons vide agreements dated 19-11-2008.\n  It is contended by the learned counsel for the defendant that sale agreement dated 6-2-2008 was fabricated, forged and fake document and no such document was executed by the defendant. Since the plaintiff failed to pay the balance amount of Rs.20,50,000 the defendant had cancelled the agreement vide legal notice dated 29-9-2008 and thereafter defendant sold the flats constructed on second and third floor on 19-11-2008 to Mrs. Farzana Shahid and Mr. Altaf respectively. The learned counsel for the defendant submits that no stay can be granted as the defendant has sold the said flats on the second and third floors to the above named persons vide agreements of sale dated 19-11-2008 before notice of stay application was served on the defendant.\n  After hearing the arguments of the learned counsel, perusal of the documents, it can be prima facie concluded that (a) there was some agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant whereby the suit property was to be sold by the defendant to the plaintiff after completion of the suit property by the defendant (b) there was some delay on the part of the defendant to complete the construction, (c) a sum of Rs.17,50,000 was paid by the plaintiff to the defendant, (d) no title has been transferred in favour of alleged purchasers by the defendant and (e) the defendant had also delivered the possession of all that Flat No.G-2, Ground Floor, Labbaik Plaza, Plot No.36-39-64 opposite Sulemania Masjid, Ganj Shakar Colony, Zeera Chowk, Jamsheed Road No.1, Karachi for occupation of plaintiff, which is still in the possession of the plaintiff.\n  Plaintiff has made out a prima facie case and the balance of convenience lies in his favour as he paid a sum of Rs.17,50,000 to the defendant which has been admitted by the defendant. For the aforesaid reasons defendant is hereby directed not to hand over the possession of the roof, top to any person and further not to 'dispose of, convey or transfer the suit property to any person by way of sale-deed, sub-lease deed or any other transfer deed. The above restraining order shall be subject to the plaintiff depositing the balance sale consideration amounting to Rs.19,00,000 with the Nazir of this Court within one month from the date hereof. The Nazir shall invest this amount along with the earlier amount of Rs.1,50,000 deposited by the plaintiff in some government profit bearing security.\n  C.M.A. No.10902 of 2008",

Facts of the case, in brief, are that respondent No.1 Muhammad Ikhtiar brought a suit before the learned District Judge, Vehari, in his original civil jurisdiction for recovery of an amount of Rs.5,00,000 on the basis of pro note dated 14-3-2002, against respondent No.2 Muhammad Yousaf alias Aoosa son of Qasim Ali. The said suit was decreed in favour of respondent No.1 and against respondent No.2 vide judgment and decree dated 5-5-2006; that the respondent No.1/decree holder instead of getting the decree executed against respondent No.2', got attached the property owned by the petitioner, and the petitioner filed an objection petition before the learned executing Court denying that he was surety of the decretal amount, rather he had stood surety only for the appearance of respondent No.2/judgment-debtor before the Court and further that about one year before passing of the decree in the suit the petitioner had filed an application for withdrawal of the surety bond; that along with the objection petition the petitioner also filed an application for interim injunction for the release of his property; that the learned executing Court vide order dated 19-12-2008 imposed a condition for depositing the decretal amount of Rs.5,15,022 before his objection was considered. The petitioner felt aggrieved against the said order dated 19-12-2008 and filed an appeal before the learned District Judge, Vehari, along with which he filed an application seeking suspension of the operation of the order dated 19-12-2008 of the executing Court/Civil Judge, Vehari. The said appeal was converted into reversion petition. The said revision petition was dismissed by the learned District Judge vide order dated 26-9-2009. The said order has been assailed through this writ petition.\n  3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the decree was not passed against the petitioner, but it was passed against respondent No.2 Muhammad Yousaf so the learned executing Court wrongly ordered the petitioner to deposit Rs.5,15,022. Further submits that the petitioner was only surety for appearance of respondent No.2/judgment debtor before the executing Court therefore he could not be held responsible for the amount of decree passed in favour of respondent No.1, as such the order passed by the executing Court is illegal, without lawful authority, void ab initio and it should be set aside, and that the executing Court should attach the property of the judgment -debtor/respondent No.2 and not of the petitioner.\n  4. I have heard the petitioner and perused the file. Learned counsel for the petitioner admitted himself in the petition that the petitioner stood surety for respondent No.2. It is a settled principle of law that if the principal fails to fulfil his obligations, the surety steps into the shoes of the principal to do that, as such the surety is as responsible as the judgment-debtor for payment of the decretal amount. Reliance is placed on the cases reported as Rafique Hazquel Masih v. Bank Alfalah Ltd., and others 2005 SCMR 72 and Messrs State Engineering Corporation Ltd. v. National Development Finance Corporation and others 2006 CLD 687.\n  5. In the case of Rafique Hazquel Masih 2005 SCMR 72, supra, it has been held by the honourable Supreme Court as under:---\n  \"---The liability of the surety under section 128 of the Contract Act is co-extensive with; that of the principal debtor, unless it is otherwise provided by the contract---In absence of any specific stipulation in the contract, a guarantor cannot take up the plea that the Bank should enforce the liability against the principal debtor before proceedings against the guarantor. The reason being that the Bank grants loan only on the guarantee and in absence of letter/contract of guarantee the Bank may not have sanctioned the loan.\"\n  6. In the other cited case of Messrs State Engineering Corporation Ltd. 2006 CLD 687 also the honourable Supreme Court held that:---\n  \"---Section 128 is applicable in the given circumstances. The liability of the guarantor/surety is co-extensive with that of the principal debtor, unless it is otherwise provided by the contract as envisaged in section 128 of the Contract Act, 1872. They are jointly and severally liablz to pay the outstanding amount to the creditor. A guarantor cannot shirk from the liabilities incurred by him through the execution of documents...\"\n  Same is the position in the case in hand, where the petitioner stood guarantor/surety for payment of the amount of decree and submitted surety bond before the learned trial Court for payment of the amount, which would be decreed against the defendant. The contention of the petitioner is that first proceedings should be taken against the judgment-debtor then proceedings against the petitioner is not tenable in view of the ratio in the above cited judgment of the honourable Supreme Court.\n  7. The case-law, that is Asghar Abbas v. Muhammad Ramzan and 4 others 1993 CLC 1313 (Lahore), Mst. Hamida Begum and 6 others v. The Additional District Judge, Lahore and 5 others 1986 CLC 1697 (Lahore), and National Bank of Pakistan v. S.R. Rehmatullah and another PLD 1970 Lah. 330, referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioner in support of his contentions, is not akin to the facts of the case of the petitioner.\n  8. The learned executing Court correctly rejected the application of the petitioner and passed the impugned order dated 19-12-2008. The learned Additional District Judge has also rightly dismissed the revision petition of the petitioner.\n  9. This writ petition is devoid of any force, therefore, the same is dismissed in limine.\n  M.H./A-7/L Petition dismissed.",

Consequently cross-examination of landlady witness was closed and matter was adjourned for affidavit-in-evidence of present appellant.\n  22-11-2006 No one was present from appellant side. Case was adjourned for filing of affidavit-in-evidence of present appellant.\n  6-12-2006 Landlord's attorney present. None present for the present appellant Nelofar. She was given last chance to file affidavit-in-evidence on next date of hearing and it was stated that if she fails to file affidavit-in-evidence on 13-12-2006 her side will be closed.\n  13-12-2006 None was present for present appellant and side of the tenant was closed. Landlord was directed to file written arguments on next date of hearing and landlord filed written arguments there and then.\n  16-12-2006 No one was present for tenant and ejectment application was allowed.\n  4. Ejectment application was allowed vide order dated 16-12-2006 on the ground of personal need. Court below held as under:---\n  \"Under para 6 of the ejectment petition the petitioner submitted that she is in financial crises and not in position to meet her both ends on the meagre rent being paid by the respondent and as such she has decided to start her own business and for this purpose she required the demised shop for her personal bona fide use in good faith. The petitioner further submitted that she gave verbal notice to the respondent for vacation of the demised shop six months earlier but the respondent did not pay attention. Moreover the shop was let out to the respondent to start her own business but the said shop is being run by her husband. The petitioner's attorney in his affidavit-in-evidence repeated the assertions of the landlady of the petitioner. The respondent in her written statement denied the claim of personal need of the demised shop by the petitioner being false and fabricated in nature and alleged that the petitioner wants to increase the rent as per her own wishes. She stated that the claim of the petitioner contradict as on one place she is claiming that she is in financial crises on the other hand she wants to start her own business and that too without any experience. The petitioner's attorney supported the petitioner's version regarding her personal need of the demised shop on oath in his affidavit-in-evidence which remains unchallenged/unrebutted as the respondent failed in testifying the petitioner's attorney/witness. Under such circumstances the claim of the petitioner for personal need of the demised shop proved to be correct and genuine. The issue is accordingly decided in favour of the petitioner.\"\n  5. Learned counsel for the appellant made following submissions:---\n  (i) Appellant has shown good faith because she continued to deposit advance, even after case was decided.\n  (ii) Rule that a party must suffer for negligence of counsel has been whittled down by the honourable Supreme Court. In this regard learned counsel relied upon Sherin and 4 others v. Fazal Muhammad and 4 others 1995 SCMR 584, Abdul Wahab v. Commissioner of Income Tax and another 2006 PTD 476 and Pirzada Niaz Ahmed Farooqi through legal representatives v. Muhammad Bux and others 2004 SCMR 862.\n  (iii) Learned counsel referred to diary sheet and stated that on 3-12-2006 learned Judge should have adjourned the matter for arguments and then on next date he could have decided it. Learned counsel's submission was that Court violated Order XX, rule 1, C.P.C. in taking written arguments on very day and then adjourning it for orders.\n(iv) Learned counsel referred to section 17(4) (b) of the Cantonment Rent Restriction Act, 1963 and also referred to para 13 of the written statement where it was stated that landlady had another shop available to her in Bahadurabad Area. Learned counsel submitted that there is distinction between provision contained in the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 and Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963 and therefore under the latter landlady has to discharge double burden, (a) Establishing his bona fide need, and (b) also establishing that landlady was not occupying land in any local area in the vicinity thereof. He relied upon Mst. Hajiyani Ayesha Bai v. Zahid Hussain 2001 SCMR 1301 and Messrs Ibrahim Agencies v. Messrs Panorama Enterprises Ltd. 1997 MLD 3035.\n  (v) Although, affidavit-in-evidence was filed but it was never exhibited and therefore same had no evidentiary value. Learned counsel relied upon Province of Sindh through Secretary, Ministry of Works and Communications v. Messrs Umar Khan and 3 others 1986 MLD 1421, Mst. Aziz Khatoon v. Allah Diwaya and others PLD 1952 B.J. 22 and Muhammad Ibrahim v. District Judge Appellate Authority Vehari and others 1985 CLC 2644.\n  (vi) Landlady had not specified any detail of business which she wished to start there. Hence, her eviction application was liable to be dismissed. Learned counsel relied upon Anisur Rehman v. Mst. Sharifa Khatoon and another 1986 CLC 448 and Abdul Majeed v. (1) District Judge Mirpur (2) Khalid Rauf Mir 1997 MLD 2137.\n  6. Learned counsel for respondent submitted that respondent has no shop in Bahadurabad and no detail whatsoever of said shop have been stated in the written statement. He further submitted that learned Court below has given ample opportunity to the present appellant to cross-examine landlady's witness and to produce her own evidence but present appellant did not avail such opportunity. He further submitted that order passed by the Rent Controller is a well-reasoned order.\n  7. I have considered submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and have also gone through the record as well as the case-law cited by the learned counsel for the appellant.\n  8. As to the first submission made by learned counsel for the appellant that appellant has been continuously depositing advance rent even after ejectment application was allowed. Learned counsel contended that it shows that appellant's bona fide. That may be so does it wash away the order passed by the Court below. The order of a Court has to be based on evidence. Therefore, this ground does not help the appellant.\n  9. Second argument advanced by learned counsel for appellant was that rule that client must suffer for negligence of his counsel has been whittled down of late, by the honourable Supreme Court. In this regard first case relied upon by the learned counsel was Sherin's case (supra). Facts of this case-law were that respondent sued the appellants for declaration and permanent injunction and in the plaint an alternate relief for possession was also prayed for. The suit was, therefore, valued for the purposes of court-fee and jurisdiction at Rs.200 only. Objection was raised by appellant that plaint was deficiently stamped. Trial Court appointed Local Commissioner for assessment of market value of the property. Trial Court directed the respondent to make good deficiency in the court-fee. Suit was decreed. Appeal was preferred in the Court of District Judge but the memorandum of appeal was returned to present the same in High Court as the same was found beyond pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Judge. It was re-filed in the High Court and delay in filing of the same was condoned subject to all just exceptions. However, appeal was ultimately heard. Objection on limitation was upheld and High Court took the view that there was no good ground to condone delay and - dismissed the appeal and matter went to the honourable Supreme Court. The Honourable Supreme Court observed as under:---\n  \"(5) Diligence is a state of human conduct. What should be the standard for assessing the behavior of an appellant to style him as diligent. Because of fluidity of the notion of diligence, it is difficult to set up a precise yardstick. Whether or not litigant has acted diligently and with care, would differ from case to case. Speaking broadly, a person may be said to have acted diligently, when he has informed himself of all relevant factors, taken all obvious steps and precautions, characterized by degree of effort, as in a given situation, as reasonable person would do. But, the epithet of \"reasonable\", opens wide the measure of application of this yardstick, on the factual plane, for the word \"reasonable\" is not susceptible of any precise definition. Etymologically, it signifies according to reason, which expression, itself is open to difference of opinion. Whether or not a person has acted diligently, in ultimate analysis, would depend on the circumstances of each case and cannot be determined on the foundation of any judicial or any judicial syllogism.\n  (6) The criterion of \"diligence\" for enlargement of time is prescribed by section 14 of the Limitation Act, which upon its terms applies only to the suits and applications and not to the appeals. On the other hand section 5 is applicable to the appeals but it does not apply to suits. The question of condonation of delay, therefore, has to be examined on the basis of section 5 and not section 14 of the Limitation Act. Not unoften, while examining the question of condonation of delay, in filing the appeal, the Courts have been invoking the principles underlying section 14 of the Act. The High Court has declined to condone the delay entirely on the touchstone of section 14. It is, however, to be remembered that expression \"due diligence\" and \"good faith\" appearing in section 14 do not figure in section 5. The condition prescribed in the latter section for its applicability in \"sufficient cause\" but what is sufficient cause is not capable of connotation, with exactitude and would differ from case to case. We may observe that filing of appeal in a wrong Court on account of mistaken advice tendered by the counsel canvassed on behalf of the appellants for condonation of delay by itself would not attract section 5 but when the litigant and the counsel have acted with due care and caution and their conduct does not smack of negligence, the institution of the appeal in the wrong forum may constitute a \"sufficient case\" within the meaning of section 5 for condonation of the delay.\"\n  10. In Abdul Wahab's case facts were that prior to 1st July, 1997 a reference was provided under the Wealth Tax Act, 1963 as well as the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 and same was to be filed in the first stance before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. Through amendment introduced by the Finance Act, 1997, for provisions for filing reference before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal were substituted by direct appeal to the High Court. However, by Finance Ordinance 2000 the original provision as existing up to 30th June, 1997 was resorted so far the Income Tax Ordinance 1970 was concerned. Order assailed in the appeal was passed on 15-2-2001. In accordance with amended section 27 of the Wealth Tax Act, 1963 an appeal was required to be filed before the High Court. However, counsel filed reference under mistaken view of law before Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and High Court condoned delay due to mistake of counsel.\n  11. In Pirzada Niaz Ahmed Farooq's case High Court had dismissed writ petition for non-prosecution and thereafter refused to restore it. Matter went up to the honourable Supreme Court. Objection raised by the respondent. Honourable Supreme Court observed as under:---\n  \"Be that as it may, conduct of the counsel may be reprehensible ends of substantial justice demand that the parties should not suffer on account of negligence or indifferent attitude on the part of their counsel, in whom they reposed full confidence. Indeed it is a matter of mutual trust between a client and counsel. On merits, we are not impressed with the ground urged in support of the petitions, inasmuch as, affidavit of delinquent counsel was not submitted before the Division Bench of the High Court, which has been filed for the first time explaining reasons for non-appearance before this Court, but in order to ensure that the cause is decided on merits and to do complete justice between the parties, we grant leave to appeal, convert these petitions into appeals and allow the same subject, however, to the payment of Rs.25,000 by way of compensatory costs to the respondents in each of the petitions within thirty days from today, failing which petitions shall be deemed to have been dismissed.\"\n  12. All the three cases are distinguishable. First and second cases relate to condonation of delay and third case related to a matter which was dismissed for non-prosecution. Present case is a case where between date of last attendance of appellant in the Court below on 7-6-2006 and the date when matter was finally decided on 16-12-2006 there were 8 dates. It is not a question of condonation of delay and payment of court-fee. Therefore, this ground is not tenable. A party must sink or swim on doings of its counsel.\n  13. Third ground argued by learned counsel is a reference to Order XX, rule 1, C.P.C. and it was contended by learned counsel that on 13-12-2006 when tenant's side was closed matter should have been adjourned for arguments. I am afraid. This contention is not tenable. Provisions of Civil Procedure Code are not applicable to rent proceedings before the Rent Controller and a very elaborate judgment in this regard has been rendered by Mr. Justice Sabihuddin Ahmed in Suhail Printer and others v. Shaikh Abid Ali and Company Pvt. Ltd. Civil Petitions Nos.24-K to 26-K of 2009.\n  Provisions contained in the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 and corresponding provision of section 17(4)(b) of the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act 1963 in respect of contention of learned counsel are reproduced herein below:---\n  \"Section 17(4)(b) of the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act 1963:\n  (4) A landlord may apply to the Controller for an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession:---\n  (a).........................................................\n  (i).........................................................\n  (ii).........................................................\n  (iii).........................................................\n(b) In the case of a commercial building, if:---\n  (i) He requires it in good faith for his own use, and\n  (ii) he is not occupying in the Cantonment area concerned or in any local area in the vicinity thereof in which such building is situated for the purposes of his business any other such building suitable for his needs at the time, and\n  (iii) he has not vacated such a building in the said area or vicinity without sufficient cause after the commencement of this Act.\n  \"Section 15(2)(c)(vii)'of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979:-\n  (2) The Controller shall, make an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the premises within such period as may be specified in the order, if he is satisfied that:---\n  (i).........................................................\n  (ii).........................................................\n  (iii).........................................................\n  (a).........................................................\n  (b).........................................................\n  (c).........................................................\n  (iv).........................................................\n  (v).........................................................\n  (vi).........................................................\n  (vii) The landlord requires the premises in good faith for his own occupation or use or for the occupation or use of his spouse or any of his children.\"\n  14. Indeed two provisions are different. Whereas under the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 a landlord is required to establish that he/she required premises .in good faith for his/her occupation or for the use of spouses or any children. Therefore, if a landlord has a number of premises, landlady is not burdened with any other onus beyond making a bare statement of his need and establish his bona fide. However, as far as Cantonments Rent Restriction Act 1973 is concerned, a landlord has to, firstly, demonstrate his good faith, just like he has to do in the case under the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979. It seems that in case of commercial building he also has to establish that he is not occupying in the tenement concerned or in local area/vicinity thereof any such building suitable for his possession. Thus if there is another premises available to the landlady, she has to travel beyond mere statement and to establish as to why premises chosen by her is more suitable than other premises available to her. So far as case property is concerned, it does not help the appellant. There are two points. Firstly, other premises must be either in Cantonment area concerned or in the local area in the vicinity. Property subject of this tenancy is situated in Clifton Cantonment Area. It is nobody's case that Bahadurabad is in Clifton Cantonment Area. Second aspect is local area in the vicinity. Considering the business imperatives of Clifton area and Bahadurabad area. I do not think they should be treated as vicinity of each other as far as Boutique business is concerned. In any case there has not been any evidence or issue or pleading in this regard. This is not all. All that was stated in the written statement in Court below was that she owned shop in Bahadurabad. No specifics such a shop had been disclosed. She was not cross-examined in this respect and no evidence was produced in rebuttal. Therefore, this ground is also not available to the appellant.\n  15. Next ground urged by learned counsel was that affidavit-in- evidence was not exhibited and therefore it is of no evidentiary value. First case relied upon by the learned counsel is Mst. Aziz Khatoon's case. In this case it was held that documentary evidence which was necessary for disposal of suit was not brought on the file in accordance with the law because it was neither legally admitted not proved nor tendered nor exhibited and if that evidence was ignored then there can not be any decision of the dispute between the parties and there was no alternative but to remand the case for retrial. It should be noticed that words used in this case are \"nor proved, nor tendered.\" In present case affidavit-in-evidence was tendered in the court. Secondly, case law relates to proceedings strictly governed by the Civil Procedure Code whereas the present proceedings are under the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963. Messrs Ibrahim Agency's (supra) case is also on the same point where it was stated that documents not formally tendered in evidence or exhibited cannot be relied in the proceedings. Affidavit -in-evidence in this case was tendered.\n  16. Last ground urged by the learned counsel was that nature of business was not specified. He primarily relied upon Anisur Rehman's case, it was held in that case as under:---\n  \"In the application of eviction a vague ground was given that she wanted to start business. It has not been stated as to what kind of business she wanted to do. The respondent filed her own affidavit-in-evidence. It has not been stated as to what kind of business she wanted to start. For this purpose she must put before the Controller all the necessary details which are required for granting relief. On such vague allegation as made in the eviction application or in her affidavit-in-evidence, the respondent cannot expect to get relief on the ground of requiring the shop in question for the occupation of her son.\"\n  17. The Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in Haji Mohibullah & Co. and others v. Khawaja Bahauddin 1990 SCMR 1070 and Juma Sher v. Sabz Ali 1997 SCMR 1062 has held that it is not necessary for landlord to disclose in ejectment application as to what business does he intend to start in the premises. Therefore, this ground is also not available to the present appellant.\n  18. For the above reasons this appeal is dismissed.\n  M.H./N-2/K Appeal dismissed.",

Thereafter affidavit-in-evidence was filed by the landlord. Ground was repeated verbatim. This affidavit-in-evidence was filed on 7-6-2006.

In this regard learned counsel relied upon Sherin and 4 others v. Fazal Muhammad and 4 others 1995 SCMR 584, Abdul Wahab v. Commissioner of Income Tax and another 2006 PTD 476 and Pirzada Niaz Ahmed Farooqi through legal representatives v.

Allah Diwaya and others PLD 1952 B.J. 22 and Muhammad Ibrahim v. District Judge Appellate Authority Vehari and others 1985 CLC 2644.\n  (vi) Landlady had not specified any detail of business which she wished to start there. Hence, her eviction application was liable to be dismissed. Learned counsel relied upon Anisur Rehman v. Mst. Sharifa Khatoon and another 1986 CLC 448 and Abdul Majeed v. (1) District Judge Mirpur (2) Khalid Rauf Mir 1997 MLD 2137.\n  6. Learned counsel for respondent submitted that respondent has no shop in Bahadurabad and no detail whatsoever of said shop have been stated in the written statement. He further submitted that learned Court below has given ample opportunity to the present appellant to cross-examine landlady's witness and to produce her own evidence but present appellant did not avail such opportunity. He further submitted that order passed by the Rent Controller is a well-reasoned order.\n  7. I have considered submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and have also gone through the record as well as the case-law cited by the learned counsel for the appellant.\n  8. As to the first submission made by learned counsel for the appellant that appellant has been continuously depositing advance rent even after ejectment application was allowed. Learned counsel contended that it shows that appellant's bona fide. That may be so does it wash away the order passed by the Court below. The order of a Court has to be based on evidence. Therefore, this ground does not help the appellant.\n  9. Second argument advanced by learned counsel for appellant was that rule that client must suffer for negligence of his counsel has been whittled down of late, by the honourable Supreme Court. In this regard first case relied upon by the learned counsel was Sherin's case (supra). Facts of this case-law were that respondent sued the appellants for declaration and permanent injunction and in the plaint an alternate relief for possession was also prayed for.

It was re-filed in the High Court and delay in filing of the same was condoned subject to all just exceptions. However, appeal was ultimately heard. Objection on limitation was upheld and High Court took the view that there was no good ground to condone delay and - dismissed the appeal and matter went to the honourable Supreme Court. The Honourable Supreme Court observed as under:---\n  \"(5) Diligence is a state of human conduct. What should be the standard for assessing the behavior of an appellant to style him as diligent.

In Abdul Wahab's case facts were that prior to 1st July, 1997 a reference was provided under the Wealth Tax Act, 1963 as well as the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 and same was to be filed in the first stance before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. Through amendment introduced by the Finance Act, 1997, for provisions for filing reference before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal were substituted by direct appeal to the High Court. However, by Finance Ordinance 2000 the original provision as existing up to 30th June, 1997 was resorted so far the Income Tax Ordinance 1970 was concerned. Order assailed in the appeal was passed on 15-2-2001. In accordance with amended section 27 of the Wealth Tax Act, 1963 an appeal was required to be filed before the High Court. However, counsel filed reference under mistaken view of law before Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and High Court condoned delay due to mistake of counsel.\n  11. In Pirzada Niaz Ahmed Farooq's case High Court had dismissed writ petition for non-prosecution and thereafter refused to restore it. Matter went up to the honourable Supreme Court. Objection raised by the respondent. Honourable Supreme Court observed as under:---\n  \"Be that as it may, conduct of the counsel may be reprehensible ends of substantial justice demand that the parties should not suffer on account of negligence or indifferent attitude on the part of their counsel, in whom they reposed full confidence. Indeed it is a matter of mutual trust between a client and counsel. On merits, we are not impressed with the ground urged in support of the petitions, inasmuch as, affidavit of delinquent counsel was not submitted before the Division Bench of the High Court, which has been filed for the first time explaining reasons for non-appearance before this Court, but in order to ensure that the cause is decided on merits and to do complete justice between the parties, we grant leave to appeal, convert these petitions into appeals and allow the same subject, however, to the payment of Rs.25,000 by way of compensatory costs to the respondents in each of the petitions within thirty days from today, failing which petitions shall be deemed to have been dismissed.\"\n  12. All the three cases are distinguishable. First and second cases relate to condonation of delay and third case related to a matter which was dismissed for non-prosecution. Present case is a case where between date of last attendance of appellant in the Court below on 7-6-2006 and the date when matter was finally decided on 16-12-2006 there were 8 dates. It is not a question of condonation of delay and payment of court-fee. Therefore, this ground is not tenable. A party must sink or swim on doings of its counsel.\n  13. Third ground argued by learned counsel is a reference to Order XX, rule 1, C.P.C. and it was contended by learned counsel that on 13-12-2006 when tenant's side was closed matter should have been adjourned for arguments. I am afraid. This contention is not tenable. Provisions of Civil Procedure Code are not applicable to rent proceedings before the Rent Controller and a very elaborate judgment in this regard has been rendered by Mr. Justice Sabihuddin Ahmed in Suhail Printer and others v. Shaikh Abid Ali and Company Pvt. Ltd. Civil Petitions Nos.24-K to 26-K of 2009.\n  Provisions contained in the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 and corresponding provision of section 17(4)(b) of the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act 1963 in respect of contention of learned counsel are reproduced herein below:---\n  \"Section 17(4)(b) of the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act 1963:\n  (4) A landlord may apply to the Controller for an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession:---\n  (a).........................................................\n  (i).........................................................\n  (ii).........................................................\n  (iii).........................................................\n(b) In the case of a commercial building, if:---\n  (i) He requires it in good faith for his own use, and\n  (ii) he is not occupying in the Cantonment area concerned or in any local area in the vicinity thereof in which such building is situated for the purposes of his business any other such building suitable for his needs at the time, and\n  (iii) he has not vacated such a building in the said area or vicinity without sufficient cause after the commencement of this Act.\n  \"Section 15(2)(c)(vii)'of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979:-\n  (2) The Controller shall, make an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the premises within such period as may be specified in the order, if he is satisfied that:---\n  (i).........................................................\n  (ii).........................................................\n  (iii).........................................................\n  (a).........................................................\n  (b).........................................................\n  (c).........................................................\n  (iv).........................................................\n  (v).........................................................\n  (vi).........................................................\n  (vii) The landlord requires the premises in good faith for his own occupation or use or for the occupation or use of his spouse or any of his children.\"\n  14. Indeed two provisions are different. Whereas under the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 a landlord is required to establish that he/she required premises .in good faith for his/her occupation or for the use of spouses or any children. Therefore, if a landlord has a number of premises, landlady is not burdened with any other onus beyond making a bare statement of his need and establish his bona fide. However, as far as Cantonments Rent Restriction Act 1973 is concerned, a landlord has to, firstly, demonstrate his good faith, just like he has to do in the case under the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979. It seems that in case of commercial building he also has to establish that he is not occupying in the tenement concerned or in local area/vicinity thereof any such building suitable for his possession. Thus if there is another premises available to the landlady, she has to travel beyond mere statement and to establish as to why premises chosen by her is more suitable than other premises available to her. So far as case property is concerned, it does not help the appellant. There are two points. Firstly, other premises must be either in Cantonment area concerned or in the local area in the vicinity. Property subject of this tenancy is situated in Clifton Cantonment Area. It is nobody's case that Bahadurabad is in Clifton Cantonment Area. Second aspect is local area in the vicinity. Considering the business imperatives of Clifton area and Bahadurabad area. I do not think they should be treated as vicinity of each other as far as Boutique business is concerned. In any case there has not been any evidence or issue or pleading in this regard. This is not all. All that was stated in the written statement in Court below was that she owned shop in Bahadurabad. No specifics such a shop had been disclosed. She was not cross-examined in this respect and no evidence was produced in rebuttal. Therefore, this ground is also not available to the appellant.\n  15. Next ground urged by learned counsel was that affidavit-in- evidence was not exhibited and therefore it is of no evidentiary value. First case relied upon by the learned counsel is Mst. Aziz Khatoon's case. In this case it was held that documentary evidence which was necessary for disposal of suit was not brought on the file in accordance with the law because it was neither legally admitted not proved nor tendered nor exhibited and if that evidence was ignored then there can not be any decision of the dispute between the parties and there was no alternative but to remand the case for retrial. It should be noticed that words used in this case are \"nor proved, nor tendered.\" In present case affidavit-in-evidence was tendered in the court. Secondly, case law relates to proceedings strictly governed by the Civil Procedure Code whereas the present proceedings are under the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963. Messrs Ibrahim Agency's (supra) case is also on the same point where it was stated that documents not formally tendered in evidence or exhibited cannot be relied in the proceedings. Affidavit -in-evidence in this case was tendered.\n  16. Last ground urged by the learned counsel was that nature of business was not specified. He primarily relied upon Anisur Rehman's case, it was held in that case as under:---\n  \"In the application of eviction a vague ground was given that she wanted to start business. It has not been stated as to what kind of business she wanted to do. The respondent filed her own affidavit-in-evidence. It has not been stated as to what kind of business she wanted to start. For this purpose she must put before the Controller all the necessary details which are required for granting relief. On such vague allegation as made in the eviction application or in her affidavit-in-evidence, the respondent cannot expect to get relief on the ground of requiring the shop in question for the occupation of her son.\"\n ",

The learned Senior Civil Judge vide judgment and decree dated 21-7-2006 had decreed the suit of plaintiff/respondent. Respondent/ plaintiff Haji Sarwar Khan and 3 others instituted a suit against the defendant in the Court of learned Senior Civil Judge, Hangu, for possession of a house situated in Khasra No.39, situated in Kach Sumbal Banda, Tehsil and District Hangu, from the defendant claiming themselves to be the owners and defendants as tenants for Rs.500 per month. In part `Bai', and amount of Rs.4500 was claimed as arrears of rent. According to the averments in the plaint, land in Khasra No.39 and other land situated in Mauza Kach Banda and Shinko Banda was the joint ownership of the predecessor of the plaintiffs/respondents namely Ghulam Hamid Khan, Abdul Haq Khan and Muhammad Amir Khan. That on 29-9-2001, private partition took place between the plaintiffs and the legal heirs of Abdul Haq Khan and Muhammad Amir etc. and as a result of such partition the entire Khasra No.39 came to the share of plaintiffs and the legal heirs of Abdul Haq and in Khasra No.39 constructed houses also came to the ownership of plaintiff and legal heirs of Abdul Haq. Further claimed that thereafter again private partition took place between the plaintiff and Mst. Younis Khatoon etc. (legal heirs of Abdul Haq) on 18-6-2002. Six constructed houses in Khasra No.39 were given to the plaintiffs whereas before the second partition the persons residing therein were the tenants of Mst. Younis Khatoon etc, (LRs of Abdul Haq) who were accordingly informed verbally about the change of ownership in the name of the plaintiffs. That at the end only defendant refused to pay the rent who was then duly served through a written notice dated 12-1-2003 for the rent but till the filing of the suit the said defendant had not paid any rent and as such suit for possession and recovery of rent was brought against him.\n  3. The petitioner/defendant contested the suit by submitting written statement wherein he denied the claim of the plaintiff-respondents and claimed that there was no relationship of landlord and tenant and that he was owner in possession of the suit house and had spent a huge amount on the said house. He has also stated in his written statement that all mutations about the ownership and possession of the disputed house were based on fraud and were liable to cancellation. On factual side, his assertion was that the entries in the column of cultivation and ownership about Khasra No.39 are wrong and against the ground reality and that the plaintiffs/respondents and their predecessor had no concern with the suit house and mutation about the change in the column of ownership and cultivation plus possession was wrong and against the law and was liable to cancellation. Similarly, he has termed the private partition between the plaintiffs and others as bogus. He has further asserted that since the life time of his father he is owner in possession of the disputed house and that the house was constructed by his father and the electricity has also been installed by his father and the meter was installed in the name of his father.\n  4. The pleadings of the parties led to the following issues:---\n  1. Whether the plaintiffs have got cause of action?\n  2. Whether the suit is not within time? '\n  3. Whether the suit is not maintainable in its present form?\n  4. Whether this Court has jurisdiction?\n  5. Whether plaintiff is estopped to sue?\n  6. Whether the relationship of landlord/tenant exist between the parties?\n  7. Whether the deeds of private partition of the suit-land are true?\n  8. Whether the entries in Revenue' Record regarding the Khasra No.39 is correct?\n  9. Whether plaintiffs are the owners of the suit land?\n  10. Whether any notice regarding payment of rent was made to the defendant?\n  11. Whether the defendant is liable to be evicted?\n  12. Whether plaintiffs are entitled to the relief sought?\n  13. Relief?\n  5. The parties led their evidence and the learned Senior Civil Judge after detailed discussion decreed the suit of the plaintiff against the defendants according to the prayer made therein.\n  6. The said judgment and decree of the learned trial Court was challenged in appeal before the learned Additional District Judge, Hangu which appeal was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 22-10-2007. Hence this argumentative revision petition.\n  7. The learned counsel for the petitioner mainly argued that it has not been established and remained unresolved as to whether the suit house is situated in Khasra No.39. He further submitted that the subsequent change after settlement in the Revenue Record could have not been relied upon and the old entries made during the settlement should have been given preference. He next contended that the question of limitation has also not been properly addressed by the Courts below as the suit was time-barred. He also contended that suit for mere possession was not competent.\n  8. The learned counsel for the respondents/plaintiffs argued that the two Courts below have correctly appreciated the evidence as well as the law. He submitted that the suit was well in time and that in private partition it had come to the ownership of the plaintiffs/respondents and that the issue that the suit house is situated in Khasra No.39 has been resolved.\n  9. In the case in hand, plaintiff claims to be landlord/owner of the suit house on the basis of ownership through his predecessor Ghulam Hamid Khan etc. and private partition effected between the Legal heirs of Abdul Haq and Muhammad Amir Khan and further partition between plaintiffs and legal heirs of Abdul Haq whereby plaintiff became owner of six houses and thoroughfare in Khasra No.89. After such partition except for the petitioner, other tenants of the five houses attorned to him and paid rent. However, in the case of the present petitioner, plaintiff/respondent filed suit for possession and recovery of outstanding rent with effect from July, 2002 till March, 2003 when plaintiff became the owner. Petitioner/defendant denied relationship of land and tenant and claimed to be owner by virtue of long possession of the house.\n  10. I have gone through voluminous evidence on the record which has been discussed by the Courts below.\n  11. The learned counsel for the petitioner could not persuade me to undertake reappraisal of evidence in the revisional jurisdiction specially when he failed to point out any misreading or non-reading of evidence. Much stress was placed by the learned counsel on the fact that electricity meter was installed in the suit house in the name of petitioner but the statement of P.W.4, from the office of the PESCO, sufficiently establishes that connection was allowed to the petitioner only after no objection in writing was given by the then owner. The application form for electricity connection is available at page 184 of this file and it is so written on it.\n  Except for the said electricity connection, petitioner has failed to produce any further documentary or any convincing evidence in support of his ownership.\n  12. The grounds now being urged before this Court are after-thought. It was never the case of the petitioner that the suit house was not situated in Khasra No.39. Even otherwise too if petitioner had any other reservation about the change in the Revenue Record affecting his rights, there was nothing to stop him, questioning the same before proper forum in appropriate proceedings.\n  13. Otherwise too, the old record since 1971-72 about which the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that it should have been believed, has rightly been discarded by the Courts below. The statement of P.W2. ADK with reference to the Revenue Record was recorded in detail and he makes it crystal clear that before 1971-72, the suit property was recorded as \"Maqbooza Malikan\". This P.W. further states that there is nothing whatsoever in the column of remarks about the change in the relevant column when the entry from \"Maqbooza Malikan\" was changed to \"Maqbooza Ahlian-e-Deh\". At page 23 he admits the same position and with reference to the entries of 1971-72 and Misl-e-Haqiat Exh.PW2/1 prepared during settlement, there is no entry whatsoever in the remarks column on the basis of which the above change has been brought in the year 1971-72. So the entries made in the above stated circumstances could have not been relied upon.\n  14. The suit was instituted well within time by the plaintiff-respondent when he became the owner of the suit house. Hence the suit was well in time.\n  15. Learned counsel for the petitioner also could not point out any evidence whereby the denial of relationship of landlord and tenant could be justified which otherwise seems to be frivolous. This also takes care of his objection with regard to the maintainability of the suit for recovery of possession without seeking declaration of title. As plaintiff was already owner of the property by virtue of inheritance and partition, mere denial of relationship of landlord and tenant, by the petitioner, could not convert the suit into one for title. As observed above, such denial is not based on any convincing evidence. So when the title of respondent/plaintiff was not defective, he could competently brought the suit in the present form.\n  16. In view of the above discussion, it is held that the two Courts below have rightly passed the impugned judgments and decrees. The present petition being devoid of any force is dismissed with no order as to costs.\n  H.B.T./27/P Petition dismissed.",
